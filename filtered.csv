"âThe House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO.â",NC Democrat falsely claims Republican Richard Hudson opposed insulin price cap.,"With inflation high and many Americans concerned about COVID-19, a Democratic congressional candidate in North Carolina says a Republican incumbent isnât doing enough to ease the burden of medical costs. State Sen. Ben Clark, D-Hoke, is running in the stateâs newly-drawn 9th Congressional District, where heâll face Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson if both win their primaries. The district, which leans Republican, is located in south-central North Carolina near Fayetteville. On April 1, Clarkâs campaign emailed supporters slamming Hudson for how he voted the day before. The email said: ""Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO."" Clarkâs campaign also tweeted about Hudson, posting that he ""voted no to lowering the cost of insulin for every family in the 9th Congressional District."" What legislation was Clark talking about? And did Hudson really vote against lowering insulin costs? A review of the record shows Clark got this wrong. The U.S. House of Representatives on March 31 voted on H.R.6833, known as the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin co-payments for insured Americans at $35 a month.It would help some Americans save hundreds of dollars annually and offer all insured patients more predictable insulin costs, but wouldnât help the uninsured, the  Associated Press reported . The Democrat-led bill passed 232-193 with the help of 12 Republicans â and congressional records show  Hudson was one of them . Several media outlets â including  Business Insider , the  Daily Mail  and  Yahoo! News  â named Hudson among the billâs Republican supporters. PolitiFact NC reached out to Clarkâs campaign shortly after it published the email and tweet about Hudsonâs vote. The campaign, which  deleted its tweet  about Hudson, defended its accusations. As far as we know, the Clark campaign hasnât issued a correction to its email. ""We are aware that last night Richard Hudson changed his vote on capping the cost of insulin to $35/month after voting against this and other bills to reduce the cost of prescription drugs numerous times,"" the campaign said. ""After being consistently rated as one of the most conservative Republicans in the House, no one is fooled by his recent shift to the center."" We asked the campaign what it meant when it said Hudson changed his vote, but didnât receive a response. Hudsonâs office said the congressmanâs March 31 vote is in line with other efforts to reduce insulin prices. Jordan Shaw, one of Hudsonâs advisors, said Hudson  co-sponsored  the Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2019, or H.R. 19, which would have capped the cost of insulin for  some Medicare customers . ""Congressman Hudson was proud to vote to cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors on insulin, and has long advocated for caps on prescription drug costs like those in HR 19. He didnât change his vote,"" Shaw said.Â  Clark said: ""Yesterday, the House voted to cap insulin prices to $35/month, just $420 each year! Richard Hudson voted NO."" The congressional record and multiple media reports show Hudson voted yes. We rate Clarkâs claim False.",4/4/22,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/apr/04/ben-clark/nc-democrat-falsely-claims-republican-richard-huds/,1,,Richard Hudson voted against capping insulin prices
"Mo Brooks ""voted to cut off funding to destroy ISIS terrorists in the middle of the fight.""","Attack on Trump-backed Mo Brooks distorts his votes on ISIS.   The ad cites two Brooks votes, neither of which was an up-or-down vote on funding U.S. military operations against ISIS.     Brooksâ votes were for measures that would have required congressional authorization of the use of military force against ISIS before funding for such military action could be approved.","The Republican endorsed by former President Donald Trump for an open U.S. Senate seat in Alabama tried to undercut the U.S. fight against the ISIS terrorist organization, according to one TV ad attacking him.Â  U.S. Rep.  Mo Brooks  faces two other major GOP challengers in the May 24 primary and is being attacked in TV, radio and Facebook ads from Alabamaâs Future, a super PAC  formed  to oppose his candidacy.Â  In the  ad , a narrator said Brooks voted ""to cut off funding to destroy ISIS terrorists â in the middle of the fight."" Small text appearing in the ad alludes to Brooksâ votes for two failed proposals that had more to do with congressional authorization of military action against ISIS than cutting off funding for such action. They pertained to two amendments to Defense Department appropriations bills. National security expert John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org said the amendments ""had nothing to do with blowing up ISIS and had everything to do with a congressional assertion of having a role in the war powers.""Â  ISIS , also known as the Islamic State, seized control of territory in Syria and Iraq starting in  2014 , the year the campaign to defeat the Islamic militant group  took shape . One of Brooksâ votes regarding ISIS occurred in 2015 and the other in 2016, as major U.S. military operations were carried out. It wasnât until mid-2017 that ISIS, after losing much of the territory it had seized,  collapsed . So, itâs fair to say that the two Brooks votes occurred during, as the ad claimed, ""the middle of the fight,"" according to Pike and national security expert Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who oversees Valens Global, a private national security consulting firm. But both said the adâs claim against Brooks is oversimplified. Alabamaâs Future has spent $2.89 million in the 2021-22 election cycle,  according  to the nonprofit Open Secrets. Itâs not clear who organized the group, which  does not  disclose its donors to the Federal Election Commission. Alabamaâs Future did not respond to our requests for information about the claim in the ad weâre checking. But the ad â along with another  version  of the TV ad weâre checking,Â   two   radio  ads and a  Facebook  ad â identifies the two Brooks votes.Â  In both cases, Brooks voted in favor of an amendment to annual appropriations bills for the Defense Department. Neither amendment passed. On June 11, 2015, the House  voted  on an  amendment  to the 2016 appropriations  bill . The amendment would have prohibited the use of funds for Operation Inherent Resolve, as the campaign to defeat ISIS was known, without Congress first enacting a law authorizing the use of military force against ISIS. The amendment failed on a vote of 231-196. Brooks was one of 33 Republicans to vote yes, along with 163 Democrats, including Pelosi, the House speaker. The other six Alabama House  members , including the lone Democrat, Terri Sewell, voted no.Â  The amendmentâs sponsor, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,  said  at the time that he wanted no money spent ""for the war against ISIS after a certain date in March of next year unless Congress authorizes a war against ISIS."" The second vote came on June 16, 2016, when the House  voted  on an  amendment  to the 2017 appropriations  bill . The amendment would have prohibited funds being obligated for combat operations in Iraq or Syria unless an authorization for the use of military force, known as an AUMF, had been enacted.Â  That amendment was proposed by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass. He  said  at the time: ""Quite simply, if you want the money to fight a war, then pass an AUMF."" The amendment failed on a vote of 285-130. Brooks was one of 17 Republicans to vote for the amendment, along with 118 Democrats, including Pelosi. Again, the other Alabama House  members  voted no. Gartenstein-Ross said that had either amendment become law, the funding for the fight against ISIS would have come to an end â but in that case, Congress could simply have taken the separate step of authorizing such military action. ""Itâs highly likely"" that Congress would have approved an authorization for the use of military force, he said. A key aim of the amendments was to give Congress authority over the military actions that had been originally authorized after the 9/11 terrorist attacks some 15 years earlier, Gartenstein-Ross said. Thatâs significant because that  military force authorization  specifically targeted organizations and persons who ""planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001,"" and by the time Brooksâ amendment votes were taken, ISIS had split from al-Qaida, the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks, Gartenstein-Ross said. Michael O'Hanlon, director of research in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, said some House members would only have supported funding for the war against ISIS if there were first congressional authorization. But some members voting for the amendments were simply trying to restore stronger congressional oversight on the use of force by the United States, he said. Brooksâ campaign noted that Brooks voted for  the   two  appropriations bills themselves.Â  In February 2015, Brooks  raised  questions about how spending money on fighting ISIS would affect other defense priorities and whether other nations would help the U.S. combat ISIS. And in June 2015, Brooks  said  an authorization of force proposed by President Barack Obama was ""weak"" because it was vague and had a three-year time limit.Â  ""If weâre going to get in there, the president needs to have whatever authorization he needs to win and Iâll vote for that kind of authorization for use of military force,"" Brooks said. ""But Iâm not going to vote for one that replicates the problems and loss of lives associated with Vietnam, where we donât get in there to win, where we hamstring ourselves.""Â  Brooks has  faced   criticism  for the votes before. A  2017  ad made a similar attack on Brooks, claiming he ""voted to cut off funding to fight ISIS."" A Birmingham TV stationâs fact-check  called  the claim ""true but misleading.""Â  The Alabama race is to succeed Republican Sen.  Richard Shelby , who was first elected to the Senate in 1986 and is not seeking re-election.Â  The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split  50-50 . Since campaign watchers rate the race as  safe  or  solid   Republican , the outcome of the May 24  primary  is key.Â  The other major GOP candidates are former Shelby aide Katie Britt and Army veteran Mike Durant. If no candidate receives a majority of the votes, a primary runoff election for the top two finishers would be held June 21. Alabamaâs Future claimed in an ad that Brooks ""voted to cut off funding to destroy ISIS terrorists in the middle of the fight."" The ad alludes to two votes, one in 2015 and one in 2016 during U.S. combat operations against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Neither was an up-or-down vote on funding military operations against the terrorist group. What Brooks voted for were measures that would have required congressional authorization of military action against ISIS before any funding of such operations could be approved. The ad contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

"Eric Schmitt âsponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollarsâ on cargo hub for airlines ""owned by China's Communist Partyâ and ""voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland.""","In race for open US Senate seat in Missouri, fact-checking a PAC attack on Eric Schmitt over China.   A bill Schmitt sponsored originally called for $480 million in tax credits, not state expenditures, for the Missouri hub.     A law Schmitt voted for allows for limited ownership of Missouri agricultural land by foreign businesses.","Some Republicans running for open U.S. Senate seats are being hit from the right with attack ads that accuse them of cozying up to China. One of the ads, from a conservative super PAC that is funded by a large Illinois GOP donor, used the Winter Olympics in Beijing as a backdrop to brand Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt as ""good for China, bad for Missouri."" The  TV ad  from Team PAC, which is  supporting  former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens in the race, is called ""Mao Money."" It  aired  Feb. 4  during  the broadcast of the opening ceremonies of the Games.Â  The ad opened with images of fireworks behind the words ""China 2022."" The narrator said, ""How did China get so powerful? Friends like Eric Schmitt."" Then it makes a two-part claim. ""Schmitt sponsored a bill to spend $480 million of your tax dollars to create a cargo hub here for airlines owned by China's Communist Party to flood Missouri markets with cheap Chinese imports,"" the narrator continued, ""and Schmitt voted to let China buy up Missouri farmland."" Both parts of the claim are rooted in bills Schmitt supported in the legislature, but they omit important context about the effect of the legislation. The first part of the super PACâs claim centers on a 2011 bill Schmitt proposed as a state senator, connected to what was known as the China Hub Project.Â  As  reported  by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the initial bill would have offered up to $480 million worth of tax breaks over 15 years to spur foreign trade through Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The bill was proposed as St. Louis leaders entered their fourth year of negotiations with Chinese officials over a freight hub at the airport, and two months after the Chinese directed their largest freight carrier â China Cargo Airlines â to begin direct talks with the airport, the story said. Schmitt  argued  at the time that the tax credits would be issued only if certain investment and trade occurred. His bill called for $420 million of incentives to build warehouses and distribution centers within a 50-mile radius of Lambert; and $60 million in tax credits for companies shipping exports out of Missouri. Schmitt said facilities built under the bill could be used to store meat that could be sent to China. Without the bill, Schmitt didnât see the China hub materializing, the St. Louis Beacon  reported . The Team PAC ad didnât mention the hubâs potential to handle exports, but one of the articles it cited, a St. Louis Post-Dispatch  editorial , said the City of St. Louis was negotiating with China Cargo Airlines ""to bring Chinese-made goods to America through Lambert and to take American goods and agricultural products back overseas."" To back its claim that the airline was ""owned by China's Communist Party,"" the super PAC ad cited a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  filing  for 2011 by Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, in connection with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The 2011 filing does not make clear the precise level of Chinese government ownership in China Cargo. Hereâs what it does say: Most of the major airline companies in China were majority-owned either by the central government or by provincial or municipal governments in China. The Chinese government controlled a 59.53% equity stake in a holding company that was China Easternâs biggest shareholder. China Eastern owned 51% of ""subsidiary"" China Cargo. So the filing indicates that the Communist government had at least an indirect stake in China Cargo. Under the version ultimately approved by the Missouri legislature, Schmittâs  bill  would have  provided   $360 million  in tax credits. But the bill  was not  signed into law, and the  project   was scrapped . The second part of the claim alludes to a 2013 state  law , which Schmitt  voted   for , on the ownership of agricultural land by foreign businesses.Â  Before the law, foreign businesses generally were prohibited from owning agricultural land in Missouri; the change loosened the prohibition, capping foreign ownership at 1% of Missouriâs total agricultural acreage. The measure was approved over the veto of then-Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat. The law allowed a Chinese company, Shuanghui International of Hong Kong, to buy Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which owned Missouri farmland at the time, the Post-Dispatch  reported .Â  But what Schmitt voted for was not approval of any specific land purchases by China. China is a recurring theme in ads for Senate contests in several states. In a race for an open seat in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz  accused  fellow Republican David McCormick of giving Chinese companies billions of dollars through the hedge fund he ran. A super PAC supporting Republican Josh Mandel for an open seat in Ohio  claimed  that Republican Jane Timkenâs family business moved jobs to China. Meanwhile, Alex Lasry, one of the Democrats challenging GOP incumbent Ron Johnson in Wisconsin,  pledged  to ""finally stand up to China."" The Missouri race is to succeed two-term GOP Sen. Roy Blunt, who is  not  seeking re-election. The primary is  Aug. 2  for the seat, which is  rated   as   solid  Republican. Greitens  resigned as governor in 2018 after facing a felony computer tampering charge, which was dropped, and allegations related to an extramarital affair.  Schmitt  formerly served as Missouriâs secretary of state and as a state senator.Â  The other GOP candidates include U.S. Reps.  Vicky Hartzler  and Billy Long; Longâs campaign gained attention for  running an ad  claiming that Democrats ""rigged"" the 2020 presidential election.

âAshley Hinson voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill that made this money (for Iowa's locks and dams) possible. Once again sheâs taking credit for work she didnât do.â,Ashley Hinson took credit for Iowa locks and dams projects after opposing the projects in Congress. U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson said she helped to secure work on Iowaâs locks and dams that is financed with Infrastructure Investment and Jobs funds. Iowa state Sen. Liz Mathis said Hinson was taking credit for the funds when she did not vote for the infrastructure bill.Â  Hinson spoke out against the infrastructure bill and voted against it in July but later was included in a bipartisan letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to request that funds be allocated for direct use on the river.,"On Jan. 19, U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, sent a  press release  that said $829 million in funding was allocated from the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act  to repair and refurbish locks and dams on the upper Mississippi River. The press release served as an announcement by Hinson, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., and Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; Dick Durbin, D-Ill., Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Following the announcement, Hinson  tweeted : ""We secured $829 million in federal funding to upgrade locks & dams along the Upper Mississippi River. This is game-changing for Iowaâs agriculture industry & our Mississippi River communities!""Â  The tweet garnered plenty of criticism from Democrats for her use of the word ""we"" in the statement, as she voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in July 2021 that is  funding the program .Â  Iowa state Sen. Liz Mathis, D-Hiawatha,  responded  to Hinsonâs tweet, accusing Hinson of taking credit for work she didnât do. ""Ashley Hinson voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill that made this money possible. Once again sheâs taking credit for work she didnât do,"" she said. Mathis is seeking the Democratic Partyâs nomination to challenge Hinson in the 2022 election for Iowaâs reconfigured 2nd Congressional District.Â  ""This is yet another example of Ashley Hinson claiming that she supports investments that benefit Iowans, but voting along party lines against their best interests in Washington,"" Mathis wrote in an email to The Daily Iowan. The bill passed in the U.S. House on July 1 by a  221 to 201 vote , and then the U.S. Senate on Aug. 10 by a  69 to 30 vote . The only Iowans to vote in favor of the bill were Democrat Rep. Cindy Axne and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.Â  In a Jan. 20 press call to Iowa reporters, Hinson said she opposed the act because it was tied to social spending. However, she said, the money was going to be spent regardless once the bill was signed into law and Iowa should get its share. ""If thereâs federal money on the table, do you think Iâm going to sit back and let that go to states like California and New York? Hell no. Iâm going to make sure as much of it comes back to Iowa,"" Hinson said.Â  The $829 million allocated to fix parts of the Mississippi River came after Hinson, Bustos, Grassley, Durbin and Blunt requested in a Dec. 10  letter  to the Corps of Engineers that projects in the upper Mississippi River area get priority for infrastructure bill money. Sen. Joni Ernst, and Reps. Cindy Axne and Mariannette Miller-Meeks signed the letter as well. They did not spearhead the lobbying like the five lawmakers who worked together. Ernst and Miller-Meeks both opposed the infrastructure bill when it came to a vote.Â  The only Iowa lawmaker who did not sign the letter was Rep. Randy Feenstra.Â  In the January press release, which had statements from each member of the bipartisan Midwest congressional group, Hinson said the funds are necessary for fixing the riverâs locks and dams to support supply chain movement in and out of Iowaâs 1st Congressional District. On Nov. 8, 2021, the day the infrastructure bill was presented to President Joe Biden for his signature, Hinson sent a  press release  condemning the bill, both because it was tied then to the  Build Back Better Act , and because she said it contained unnecessary spending. The infrastructure bill reauthorized the $650 billion of existing spending that is usually allocated yearly for infrastructure needs, but added $550 billion in new spending. Hinson said in the press release that she would have voted for the bill if it only featured a reauthorization of the $650 billion to go to any infrastructure needs but opposed the addition of new funds. ""Let me level with you, I think most Iowans would support reasonable spending on real, physical infrastructure.Â  However, I believe this bill adds too much additional spending for items aside from the physical infrastructure Iowans care most about, without fully paying for them,"" the press release said.Â  Grassley, who, like  Hinson ,  opposed  in September a partisan Democrat-led supplemental spending  bill  that allocated money for Mississippi River projects, supported the infrastructure bill. He signed the letter lobbying for the river funds, tweeting on  Jan. 19  and  Jan. 20  that the allocated funds, which also include money for the Missouri River valley, will be beneficial for Iowaâs agriculture.

The claim is based on the fact that Hinson voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that is funding the works project.Â  Mathis ignores in her statement that Hinson lobbied the Army Corps of Engineers to spend funds from the bill on lock and dam repairs. Hinson says she wanted to make sure Iowa got its share of money made available by the bill.Â Â Â  But, additional money Hinson voted against had to be available for the $829 billion worth of work to be done.

Chuck Grassley was âvoting to slash Medicareâ when voting against the debt ceiling bill.,"Context needed for Grassley comment about Medicare vote. Â Congress approved raising the federal governmentâs debt ceiling in December while also extending Medicare funding at current levels for three months. Â Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, objected to tying the Medicare extension to the debt ceiling and voted no on the bill, prompting back-and-forth accusations from Grassleyâs potential Democrat opponent in the 2022 election and a former Grassley staffer. Â Back-and-forth accusations are common in politics but Abby Finkenauerâs claim that Grassley voted to slash Medicare funding needs context.","Democrats controlling the U.S. Senate with Vice President Kamala Harrisâ tie-breaking vote came up with a plan earlier this month to circumvent the Senateâs 60-vote rule for raising the federal governmentâs debt ceiling: Combine in oneÂ  bill Â a procedural vote saving Medicare from automatic funding cuts for 2022 with the unusual authorization of a one-time only Senate majority vote to raise the federal governmentâs debt limit. Itâs a move journalist Lindsey McPherson called in a Dec. 13Â  Roll Call story Â ""an age-old Washington trick for must-pass legislation that requires bipartisan support: Pair the thing the minority hates with something they support and hope they feel the good outweighs the bad."" The legislation passed 59 to 35, with 10 Republicans voting yes and six senators not voting.Â  The ploy didnât pass muster for Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, though, who voted against the legislation. Grassley said he opposed the part that authorized raising the debt ceiling without a 60-vote Senate approval. That brought a response from Democrat Abby Finkenauer, the former U.S. representative from Iowa running in 2022 for the seat Grassley holds. FinkenauerÂ  tweeted Â on Dec. 9: ""Itâs not surprising that @ChuckGrassley would fight to preserve the filibuster while voting to slash Medicare, but itâs sure as heck not acceptable. D.C. hasnât been working for DECADES and this guy is the problem."" Michael Zona, former spokesman for the Senate Finance Committee and Grassley when Grassley led that committee, saw the tweet andÂ  responded :Â  ""Another day, another lie. Grassley explicitly stated he supported the Medicare policies. Honesty isnât Abbyâs strong suit. Abby accomplished nothing in the House and now she has opinions about how the Senate should operate. Iâm gathering humility isnât her strong suit either."" Finkenauerâs campaign staff called foul, saying Zona unfairly accused Finkenauer of lying. Zona told PolitiFact Iowa he was referring specifically to the assertion that Grassley voted to slash Medicare, so we looked at the record. Defining political opponentsâ actions in ways that provoke negative emotion also is an age-old Washington trick, practiced in abundance in a town whose major industry is influencing others to take preferred actions on behalf of the public. With this approach, failing to vote yes on a bill that stops automatic Medicare funding cuts gets defined as a vote that allows Medicare cuts. RepublicansÂ  voting no Â included Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.Â ""Itâs a bad position to be in. I donât like being put in this position,"" Ernst told Roll Callâs McPherson. ""But, you know, Medicare is important. Republicans voting no on this legislation thought they had something to gain:Â  pinning the blame Â for raising the federal governmentâs debt ceiling but also high spending on Democrats, even though raising the ceiling authorizes the government toÂ  pay existing bills , not take on new spending. Grassley said in aÂ  prepared statement Â that he objected to authorizing a procedural vote without the Senateâs 60-vote requirement to increase the debt ceiling in an otherwise non-controversial bill.Â  ""I support the health care-specific provisions reflected in the Medicare extenders package, which the Senate will soon take up, that would prevent cuts and changes to Medicare providers,"" he said, referring to an upcoming procedural vote on extending legislation. ""In fact, I supported an amendment that would have provided for a clean Medicare extender package.""Â  Grassley had joined Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, Ernst and 19 other senators on Dec. 8 in support ofÂ  an amendment Â that would have eliminated the last portion from the legislation. That portion â Section 8 âÂ  contained the language giving the Senate authority to expedite through Dec. 31 a vote on raising the debt limit a non-specified amount by using a joint resolution, which would allow a simple majority vote instead of a 60-vote majority to pass. The amendment failed. ""Had the bill not included the debt ceiling provision, Sen. Grassley would have supported it,"" Grassleyâs communications director Taylor Foy wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa. Foy sent a list of 16 legislative bills Grassley supports that provide Medicare access and health care benefits. Grassley sponsored some of them, including theÂ  Rural Health Clinic Protection Act Â that was part ofÂ  legislation Â signed into law in April that also spared Medicare for nine months of automatic 2% spending cuts. The latest action stops cuts for three months.Â Medicare was headed for a 2% sequestration cut on Jan. 1 and a mid-JanuaryÂ 4% cut in Medicare provider payments.Â  ""Sen. Grassley supports the 60 vote threshold to reach finality on legislation, which forces bipartisanship and collaboration on proposals being considered during the normal course of action in the Senate,"" Foy wrote. ""But, that wasnât his chief concern regarding the process in this particular instance. His procedural concern here is that a supposed âone-timeâ change of the Senate rules (whether related to vote thresholds or not) rarely results in a one-off event, and tactics to sidestep the Senateâs standing rules are often repeated once the precedent is set."" Christian Slater, Finkenauerâs campaign communications director, countered in a PolitiFact Iowa interview that Finkenauer was on solid ground and not lying about Grassleyâs vote. The legislation before the Senate specifically protected Medicare funding from being cut, and Grassley voted against it, he said. ""It doesnât matter what you theoretically support â you voted to cut Medicare,"" Slater said. Slater had a list, too, of votes Grassley took in 2012 and 2013 on proposals by then U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, to cut federal spending. The 2012 budgetÂ  proposal , which failedÂ  41 to 58 , capped Medicare beneficiary payments for people under the age of 55 at 2012 levels, with annual, inflationary adjustments. Democrats said then that Republicans voted to end Medicare, earning PolitiFactâs 2011 Lie of the YearÂ  designation , although PolitiFact noted that Democratsâ assertion that the Republican plan would privatize Medicare wasÂ  Mostly True . Slater cited that privatization attempt as a bid to cut Medicare funding. He cited Grassley votesÂ  to revisitÂ  the Ryan budget proposal in Â 2012 Â and also a 2013 Grassley vote on an involved budget amendment to bring down proposed fiscal 2014 spending, revise spending levels for fiscal 2013 and set federal budget levels through 2023.Â  That budget amendment was tied to a Ryan budget proposal to rein in the federal spending growth rate and included aÂ  Medicare policy Â that would have givenÂ seniors the option of using subsidies to buyÂ  private health insurance .Â The moves failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate. This time around, Grassley voted against legislation that, had his side prevailed, would have resulted in automatic cuts to Medicare funding unless further action were taken. Why? Because of budgetÂ  sequestration , the method by which federal funding is cut automatically under theÂ  Budget Control Act of 2011 Â that allowsÂ spending caps if spending exceeds congressional appropriations. Zona countered by referring to the 2021 Medicare and debt ceiling legislationâs words. For Finkenauerâs assertion to be true, Zona said, the legislation would have had to state specifically that Medicare was being slashed. It does not use those words, he said. ""There was never a vote to cut Medicare funding, or to slash it,"" Zona, who is out of government now and spokesman and senior vice president at a public affairs company, Bullpen Strategy, told PolitiFact Iowa in an interview. He followed up in an email, writing that Grassley delivered as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee expanded Medicare benefits to ""tens of millions of Americans."" Finkenauer said Grassleyâs vote against the combined Medicare extension and debt ceiling meant voting to slash Medicare. Is Finkenauer lying, as Zona tweeted? She is correct about Grassley declining to vote in this instance to stave off a pending Medicare funding cut and, for that matter, about wanting to preserve the Senateâs 60-vote rule. But the legislation did not specifically call for slashing Medicare funding â if a 2% cut fits the definition of slashing â or close the door on finding another way to avoid cutting Medicare funding. The exchange between Finkenauer and Grassley is just the latest example of the two parties forcing their opponents to vote on combinations of measures that force them to choose between voting for something they donât like, or voting against something they do. If they pursue the latter course, it can be weaponized into campaign attacks. Both parties do this regularly. Figuring out how Congress works through various pieces of legislation and how debate is carried out in a political dispute like this benefits from having context.

North Carolina U.S. Senate candidates Mark Walker and Ted Budd were both in Congress when Trump signed the farm bill in 2018. Walker voted for it and Budd voted against it. However, Walker's description of the bill is misleading. It did not include major changes to work requirements for people seeking welfare benefits.","A Republican U.S. Senate candidate in North Carolina is questioning a primary opponentâs commitment to local farmers and to policies championed by former President Donald Trump. Former U.S. Rep.  Mark Walker  took exception when U.S. Rep.  Ted Budd tweeted  on July 16 that he supports North Carolinaâs agriculture industry. Walker tweeted:Â  ""False. In 2018, while I worked with Ron DeSantis and Pres Trump to pass a Farm Bill that helped farmers, invest in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults, Budd voted NO."" (DeSantis was a Florida congressman then.) Walker, Budd and former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory are three of the biggest names among the  six candidates  on the Republican side. McCrory,  piggy-backing  on Walkerâs tweet, also took the opportunity to bash Budd. Their tweets aim to erode Republican votersâ trust in  Budd , who Trump  endorsed . In this fact check, weâll explore the following questions: Is Walker right about their voting records on the farm bill? Did Walker accurately describe the farm billâs contents? What does Budd say about the vote, and is his explanation accurate? It turns out, Walker is right about Budd opposing the farm bill. The bill did also expand the governmentâs  rural broadband loan program . But Walkerâs suggestion that it ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" is misleading. One major reason the bill became law: the Senate scrapped the Houseâs proposed changes to the welfare eligibility requirements. The federal farm bill is usually renewed every five years. And in 2018, Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. However, they struggled to pass legislation as their members disagreed over policies affecting agriculture, food stamps and even  immigration . Budd and Walker were in Congress in 2018 and at times voted with different wings of their party on the legislation, which was revised several times. In a  May 18 vote  on an early version of the farm bill, officially known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Budd voted no and Walker voted yes.Â  While Walker voted with House leadership in support of the bill, Budd opposed it along with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The  caucus withheld its support  because leadership didnât commit to a vote on their preferred immigration bill. In a  June 21 vote , both voted yes on a version that aimed to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known for providing food stamps. The bill sought to tighten eligibility criteria and impose stricter work requirements on up to 7 million food stamp recipients,  Politico reported .Â  In a  Dec. 12 vote , the House approved a bill that strayed from their June 21 version and adopted more of the Senateâs preferences. Walker supported the compromise bill and Budd voted no. On Dec. 20, Trump signed this version of the bill. Walker said the bill ""helped farmers, invest(ed) in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" Itâs fair to say the first two claims in that sentence are true. However, the part about work requirements is misleading. The bill that Walker voted on (and Trump signed)  famously   left   out  major SNAP benefit changes that the House passed and  Trump initially called for .Â  A report by the  Congressional Research Service  said the bill made only a ""few eligibility changes. Specifically, the bill ""reduced state waivers for work requirements, meaning states could exempt only 12% of their SNAP recipients from work requirements, as opposed to the 15% in the 2014 Farm Bill,"" according to a blog on the Harvard Universityâs  Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation  website The omission of major changes, though, was ""key"" in reaching a compromise, according to  an expert  who wrote a  paper on the bill negotiations . It was also one of the reasons Budd opposed it, according to senior campaign advisor Jonathan Felts.Â  ""The 2018 Farm Bill stripped out the important reforms that would have promoted more stringent work requirements for those receiving welfare assistance,"" Felts said. The Walker campaign, for its part, pointed out that Trump announced efforts to increase work requirements when he signed the bill. ""Millions of able-bodied, working-age adults continue to collect food stamps without working or even looking for work,"" Trump said during the  bill-signing ceremony on Dec. 20 . ""Therefore, I have directed (Agriculture Secretary Sonny) Perdue to use his authority under the law to close work requirement loopholes in the food stamp program. Under this new rule, able-bodied adults without dependents will have to work, or look for work, in order to receive their food stamps."" But that effort was  separate from the farm bill , and quickly faced  legal challenges . Last October, a  federal judge blocked  Trumpâs rule to apply work requirements through the Agriculture Department. Apart from the SNAP benefits, PolitiFact wondered if the Budd campaignâs description of farm subsidies was accurate. In that email to PolitiFact, Felts described it this way: ""As any family farmer will tell you, you donât support the farm by giving away the farm, and the 2018 Farm bill was bloated with overspending that also left out critical reforms to federal farm subsidies that would have better directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it the most."" Vincent Smith , an agriculture policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that the bill was bloated. Virtually ""any self respecting economist would say that money is flowing to folks that donât need it and businesses that would be perfectly viable without it,"" Smith told PolitiFact NC in a phone interview. What about Buddâs claim that the bill left out reforms that would have ""directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it?"" Smith said Budd has a point, but that his explanation could give people a misconception about American farm ownership. ""The candidate is right that these monies (in the farm bill) were heavily targeted to the largest farms,"" Smith said. ""Now, 98% of all farms would describe themselves as family-owned farms. Only 2% are owned by significant corporate entities."" In other words, it would be misleading to suggest the farm bill didnât help family farms. It did. But Budd is right that  larger farms benefit the most  from the governmentâs system for offering more subsidies to farms that produce more crops. To be clear, the bill when signed simply renewed many of the agriculture policies that were  already law . And while  many agricultural groups  supported the bill, it also had its critics. Farm Aid, the group founded by Willie Nelson and other musicians, commended Congress for finally passing the legislation. However, it said the bill ""fails spectacularly"" to address the core challenges facing farms. ""The future of family farm agriculture requires a dramatic shift in policy towards fair pricing, supply management programs, cracking down on corporate goliaths and accelerated attention to the climate crisis. By those standards, this farm bill fails,""  the group wrote  on Dec. 20. Walker said that he voted for the farm bill, which ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" and that Budd voted no. Itâs true that Walker voted for the bill that Trump signed and Budd voted against it. However, itâs misleading for Walker to say the bill ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" Walker voted for more work requirements in a bill the House passed in June, but the version that Trump signed didnât include those requirements.Â  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Former U.S. Rep.  Mark Walker  took exception when U.S. Rep.  Ted Budd tweeted  on July 16 that he supports North Carolinaâs agriculture industry. Walker tweeted:Â  ""False. In 2018, while I worked with Ron DeSantis and Pres Trump to pass a Farm Bill that helped farmers, invest in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults, Budd voted NO."" (DeSantis was a Florida congressman then.) Walker, Budd and former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory are three of the biggest names among the  six candidates  on the Republican side. McCrory,  piggy-backing  on Walkerâs tweet, also took the opportunity to bash Budd. Their tweets aim to erode Republican votersâ trust in  Budd , who Trump  endorsed . In this fact check, weâll explore the following questions: Is Walker right about their voting records on the farm bill? Did Walker accurately describe the farm billâs contents? What does Budd say about the vote, and is his explanation accurate? It turns out, Walker is right about Budd opposing the farm bill. The bill did also expand the governmentâs  rural broadband loan program . But Walkerâs suggestion that it ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" is misleading. One major reason the bill became law: the Senate scrapped the Houseâs proposed changes to the welfare eligibility requirements. The federal farm bill is usually renewed every five years. And in 2018, Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House. However, they struggled to pass legislation as their members disagreed over policies affecting agriculture, food stamps and even  immigration . Budd and Walker were in Congress in 2018 and at times voted with different wings of their party on the legislation, which was revised several times. In a  May 18 vote  on an early version of the farm bill, officially known as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, Budd voted no and Walker voted yes.Â  While Walker voted with House leadership in support of the bill, Budd opposed it along with members of the conservative Freedom Caucus. The  caucus withheld its support  because leadership didnât commit to a vote on their preferred immigration bill. In a  June 21 vote , both voted yes on a version that aimed to reform the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known for providing food stamps. The bill sought to tighten eligibility criteria and impose stricter work requirements on up to 7 million food stamp recipients,  Politico reported .Â  In a  Dec. 12 vote , the House approved a bill that strayed from their June 21 version and adopted more of the Senateâs preferences. Walker supported the compromise bill and Budd voted no. On Dec. 20, Trump signed this version of the bill. Walker said the bill ""helped farmers, invest(ed) in rural broadband, and added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" Itâs fair to say the first two claims in that sentence are true. However, the part about work requirements is misleading. The bill that Walker voted on (and Trump signed)  famously   left   out  major SNAP benefit changes that the House passed and  Trump initially called for .Â  A report by the  Congressional Research Service  said the bill made only a ""few eligibility changes. Specifically, the bill ""reduced state waivers for work requirements, meaning states could exempt only 12% of their SNAP recipients from work requirements, as opposed to the 15% in the 2014 Farm Bill,"" according to a blog on the Harvard Universityâs  Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation  website The omission of major changes, though, was ""key"" in reaching a compromise, according to  an expert  who wrote a  paper on the bill negotiations . It was also one of the reasons Budd opposed it, according to senior campaign advisor Jonathan Felts.Â  ""The 2018 Farm Bill stripped out the important reforms that would have promoted more stringent work requirements for those receiving welfare assistance,"" Felts said. The Walker campaign, for its part, pointed out that Trump announced efforts to increase work requirements when he signed the bill. ""Millions of able-bodied, working-age adults continue to collect food stamps without working or even looking for work,"" Trump said during the  bill-signing ceremony on Dec. 20 . ""Therefore, I have directed (Agriculture Secretary Sonny) Perdue to use his authority under the law to close work requirement loopholes in the food stamp program. Under this new rule, able-bodied adults without dependents will have to work, or look for work, in order to receive their food stamps."" But that effort was  separate from the farm bill , and quickly faced  legal challenges . Last October, a  federal judge blocked  Trumpâs rule to apply work requirements through the Agriculture Department. Apart from the SNAP benefits, PolitiFact wondered if the Budd campaignâs description of farm subsidies was accurate. In that email to PolitiFact, Felts described it this way: ""As any family farmer will tell you, you donât support the farm by giving away the farm, and the 2018 Farm bill was bloated with overspending that also left out critical reforms to federal farm subsidies that would have better directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it the most."" Vincent Smith , an agriculture policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agreed that the bill was bloated. Virtually ""any self respecting economist would say that money is flowing to folks that donât need it and businesses that would be perfectly viable without it,"" Smith told PolitiFact NC in a phone interview. What about Buddâs claim that the bill left out reforms that would have ""directed federal assistance to small, family farms that needed it?"" Smith said Budd has a point, but that his explanation could give people a misconception about American farm ownership. ""The candidate is right that these monies (in the farm bill) were heavily targeted to the largest farms,"" Smith said. ""Now, 98% of all farms would describe themselves as family-owned farms. Only 2% are owned by significant corporate entities."" In other words, it would be misleading to suggest the farm bill didnât help family farms. It did. But Budd is right that  larger farms benefit the most  from the governmentâs system for offering more subsidies to farms that produce more crops. To be clear, the bill when signed simply renewed many of the agriculture policies that were  already law . And while  many agricultural groups  supported the bill, it also had its critics. Farm Aid, the group founded by Willie Nelson and other musicians, commended Congress for finally passing the legislation. However, it said the bill ""fails spectacularly"" to address the core challenges facing farms. ""The future of family farm agriculture requires a dramatic shift in policy towards fair pricing, supply management programs, cracking down on corporate goliaths and accelerated attention to the climate crisis. By those standards, this farm bill fails,""  the group wrote  on Dec. 20. Walker said that he voted for the farm bill, which ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults"" and that Budd voted no. Itâs true that Walker voted for the bill that Trump signed and Budd voted against it. However, itâs misleading for Walker to say the bill ""added work requirements for able-bodied adults."" Walker voted for more work requirements in a bill the House passed in June, but the version that Trump signed didnât include those requirements.Â  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Sen. Raphael Warnock âvoted for welfare for politicians plan. Up to $25 million of government money for Warnockâs own political campaign.â,"Republicans mislead in welfare attack on Raphael Warnock.   The For the People Act, a sweeping bill that makes changes to voting, campaign finance and ethics, passed the House in March. The legislation failed to proceed in the Senate amid Republican opposition.     A provision of the legislation would include an optional program for Senate candidates to get six-to-one matching on donations under $200.     The matching program would not start until 2028 and would be paid for out of surcharges on court cases and settlements.","A voting rights bill authored by Democrats includes a provision â to provide public financing of campaigns in some circumstances â that Republicans have derided as ""welfare."" After the For the People Act failed to proceed in the Senate, the National Republican Senatorial Committee launched an  ad  attacking Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., for supporting the legislation. (Warnock won his Senate seat in a special election this year and would be up for re-election in 2022.) ""He voted for welfare for politicians plan,""  says the narrator . ""Up to $25 million of government money for Warnockâs own political campaign."" A slip of paper resembling a receipt includes the text ""SR1"" â the only clue that the ad refers to the For the People Act.Â  The NRSC didnât respond to our queries seeking evidence, but it looks like they are referring to a provision that provides public matching to small dollar donations to Senate campaigns. (There is a similar counterpart in the House legislation.) The law isnât ""welfare,"" and the $25 million estimate is based on a maximum match. The For the People Act combines proposals for voter registration, absentee voting, in-person voting, campaign finance and ethics related to federal elections. The House passed the bill earlier this year. The Senate  voted 50-50  along party lines on a motion to proceed on the bill June 22, falling short of the needed 60 votes to move ahead. Technically that was a procedural motion and not a vote on the bill itself, but itâs fair to call Warnock a supporter, because he is a co-sponsor of the  previous version of the legislation . Although the bill is dead for now, politicians in both parties are continuing to talk about voting laws in advance of the midterms. Democrats want federal legislation to expand voting rights, while Republicans have argued that state lawmakers are the best equipped to set election laws for their states. One goal of the For the People Act is to reduce the power of big donors. The legislation includes a provision for  small dollar financing of Senate election campaigns , which would provide a six-to-one match for each donation in aggregate under $200. For example, if a person donated $100 to a candidate, that would result in $600 in matching funds. The idea is to reduce the role of wealthy large donors in financing political campaigns. Senate candidates who want to participate would opt in and have to meet certain criteria, such as not accepting other donations over $1,000. The matching dollars would come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" â which would come from 4.75% surcharges on federal criminal offenses and settlements. If the amount in the fund comes up short, such matching dollars would be provided on a pro-rata basis. The legislation states: ""No taxpayer funds may be deposited into the fund."" The matching program would not start until 2028, which means that Warnock isnât eligible to get any money from it for his 2022 election. Experts on the bill or campaign finance didnât generally object to the math. The legislation includes a formula and caps that would determine how much a Senate candidate could get in matching dollars. This amount varies state by state because it takes into account the stateâs size based on how many congressional districts it has.Â  The Brennan Center for Justice, a group that supports the legislation, did the math for Georgia and found it would add up to about $23.8 million â but if a candidate also got the enhanced matching funds, that would result in an extra $2.1 million, said Dan Weiner, deputy director of the Brennan Centerâs Election Reform Program. But this includes the assumption that in 2028 the race would be competitive and that Warnock would raise the maximum amount.Â  Warnock hasnât said if he would participate in the public financing program. Warnock  raised about $124 million  for his 2020 campaign, about half from small donors. If such legislation passes in the future, his opponents could use it, too. ""Both Republicans and Democrats have developed robust networks of small dollar donors, and both parties could use the program to amplify the voices of those grassroots supporters,"" said Brendan M. Fischer, director of the federal reform program at the Campaign Legal Center, an organization that supports the legislation. The NRSC called the program ""welfare"" in the ad attacking Warnock, who is Black, but not in a similar ad against  Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H , who is white.Â  Generally the term ""welfare"" is used to refer to government dollars given to low-income people to help them pay for rent, clothes, food or other basic living expenses. A small dollar matching program to encourage candidates to focus on donations from average Americans rather than millionaires isnât comparable to welfare. ""I do not think the âwelfare for politiciansâ phrase is accurate,"" said Michael Malbin, a University at Albany political scientist and expert on campaign finance. ""This is a subsidy to enhance the value of small-dollar donors. It is not meant to, and would not, benefit politicians directly."" The idea of small donor matching programs is not new â and it is not only for Democrats.Â  Presidential candidates from both major parties used a presidential public financing program between 1976 and 2008 until it became outdated, said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an organization that promotes democracy. That includes former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican. ""If they are claiming this is welfare for politicians, they are claiming Reagan was a beneficiary of welfare for politicians, because he used the system run in 1976 when he lost and in 1980 and 1984 when he won,"" Wertheimer said. Wertheimer was involved in crafting the public financing law in the 1970s, as well as the provisions in the For the People Act. For decades, multiple states have provided their own  campaign public financing programs . For example, Florida voters in 1998 approved a constitutional amendment for matching funds for statewide campaigns. In 2018, Republican  Ron DeSantis , who won the governorâs race, received more than any other candidate in matching funds, nearly $3.23 million. His opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, received $2.62 million from the program. The NRSC ad says Warnock ""voted for welfare for politicians plan. Up to $25 million of government money for Warnockâs own political campaign."" Itâs inaccurate to call the public financing for political campaigns ""welfare."" The goal of public campaign finance is to reduce the influence of rich donors and give more power to average Americans who want to donate to campaigns. Thatâs not comparable to ""welfare"" programs designed to help poor people with basic living expenses. Also, unlike programs associated with welfare, the public financing program would not come from tax dollars but surcharges on legal cases and settlements.Â  The claim is also speculative. Warnock hasnât said if he would choose to opt into the program, which wouldnât go into effect until a 2028 campaign cycle. Warnock first has to win re-election in 2022 under existing campaign finance rules.Â  We rate this statement False.  RELATED:  SC Rep.

U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz was the lone vote in the House against an anti-human trafficking bill.,"Yes, Matt Gaetz was the only no vote on 2017 human trafficking bill.   The New York Times reported that the Justice Department is investigating whether U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., violated human trafficking laws. Gaetz said the allegations about himÂ are false.     Social media posts juxtaposed the Justice Department investigation with Gaetzâs lone no vote in 2017 against a human trafficking bill that created an advisory committee.     In explaining his no vote, Gaetz said itâs important to combat human trafficking. But he said he generally opposes legislation that creates new federal entities if existing federal agencies could handle the problem.","U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetzâs vote against a human trafficking bill back in 2017 is popping up on social media following a  New York Times  report that federal authorities are investigating whether Gaetz violated human trafficking laws. The New York Times reported based on unnamed sources that the Justice Department is investigating whether Gaetz, a Florida Republican, had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paid for her to travel with him. The newspaper reported that the investigation started during the final months of the Trump administration and is part of a broader investigation into a Gaetz ally, Joel Greenberg, a former tax collector in Seminole County who was indicted on charges including  sex trafficking . Gaetz has not been charged. Gaetz said on  Twitter  and told the New York Times,  Axios  and  Fox News  that the allegations are false and are part of an effort to extort $25 million from him and his family.Â  A  Facebook post  used the popular ""how it started, how itâs going"" meme to juxtapose the Justice Department investigation with Gaetzâs past vote on a bill in Congress. How it started: ""Matt Gaetz defends lone no vote on anti-human trafficking bill."" How itâs going: ""The DOJ is reportedly investigating whether Rep. Matt Gaetz had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and violated sex-trafficking laws,"" taken from a  Business Insider headline. The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership  with Facebook.)Â  In this case, itâs accurate to say that Gaetz was the only member to vote against such a measure in 2017. The Facebook post could be interpreted to suggest that his 2017 vote led to or is somehow tied to the Justice Department investigation, but that isnât proven, and itâs not the focus of our fact-check. Gaetz really was the only vote against an anti-human trafficking bill that Trump signed into law. The reason he offered at the time was not on the billâs substance, but in favor of limiting government.Â  The  Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act  passed the Senate by  unanimous consent  in September 2017. When the House passed the bill in December 2017, Gaetz was the only  no vote . President Donald Trump signed the bill into law in January 2018. The bill directed the Transportation Department to designate an official to coordinate human trafficking prevention efforts and called for establishing an advisory committee on human trafficking. The committee submitted a 128-page  report  in July 2019 that included recommendations to combat human trafficking. Following coverage of his vote in his home newspaper, the Northwest Florida Daily News,Â  Gaetz went on  Facebook live  to explain his opposition. Gaetz called the bill ""mission creep"" and an ""expansion of the federal government"" beyond what is in the Constitution.Â  Gaetz said when a proposed bill creates a new government entity or board, his office scrutinizes the legislation. ""Unless there is an overwhelming, compelling reason that our existing agencies in the federal government can't handle that problem, I vote no because voters in Northwest Florida did not send me to Washington to go and create more federal government,"" Gaetz said. ""If anything, we should be abolishing a lot of the agencies at the federal level like the Department of Education, like the EPA and sending that power back to our state governments."" However, Gaetz said it is important to combat human trafficking â and said when he was in the state Legislaure he worked to make it easier for prosecutors to bring cases against human traffickers. We contacted Gaetzâs congressional office to ask them to point to a bill he appeared to reference but did not receive a reply by our deadline. A Facebook post said Gaetz was the lone vote in the House against an anti-human trafficking bill. In 2017, Gaetz was the lone vote against a bill that directed federal officials to take steps to combat human trafficking, including the creation of an advisory committee. Gaetz said that combating human trafficking was important, but he was against creating a new federal entity to do so. We rate this statement True.Â   RELATED:  U.S. Rep.

âSenate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison.â,"Yes, Democrats voted to send stimulus checks to prisoners, as Republicans did last year.   Democrats rejected a Republican amendment that would have barred prisoners from receiving $1,400 stimulus checks.     Democrats said the plan would hurt the families of prisoners, making it harder for them to pay their monthly bills.     Both parties supported past stimulus bills that sent checks to prisoners.","In the long hours of debate before Senate Democrats passed their sweeping COVID-19 relief package, Republicans offered amendments designed to put Democrats on record on very particular policy points. Sens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Bill Cassidy, R-La., put forward one that would prevent $1,400 stimulus checks from going to prisoners. The amendment failed on a party-line vote. Cotton tweeted that this was another example of spending tucked in the bill that had nothing to do with pandemic. ""Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,"" he tweeted  March 6 . ""They havenât lost their jobs, they arenât worried about paying rent or buying groceries."" Senate Democrats just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison.  They havenât lost their jobs, they arenât worried about paying rent or buying groceries.  Another example of the unrelated spending in the Democratsâ partisan slush fund. Cotton repeated his point  March 8  on Fox News, saying ""every single Democrat"" wanted to send checks to prisoners â invoking Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Charleston, S.C., church shooter Dylann Roof. The record shows that Democrats rejected the amendment to prevent payments to prisoners. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said it would harm prisonersâ families. ""Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,"" Durbin said on the  Senate floor . ""Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated."" Prisoners qualify for stimulus payments because of broad eligibility requirements in this relief bill â and others. Prisoners must be a citizen or legal resident, and either need to have filed a tax return, possibly as part of a joint filing, or complete an Internal Revenue Service form requesting payment.Â  Itâs worth noting that the two previous rounds of stimulus checks during the Trump administration â in the CARES Act in March, and the supplemental package in December â allowed prisoners to receive checks, too. Cotton voted for both of those bills. His press secretary James Arnold said circumstances were different. In the CARES Act, the issue was ""an unanticipated problem,"" and in December, there was no opportunity to amend the bill. The issue had come up before. In 2009, President Barack Obamaâs economic recovery package barred stimulus checks for most prisoners. Only a  few thousand  got them, through an exception in the law for those who had just gone to jail. In 2020, Washington put a priority on getting checks to people as quickly as possible. The CARES Act kept the eligibility rules broad and simple. Basically, anyone who was an American citizen or permanent legal resident, wasnât claimed as a dependent by someone else, and had filed a tax return (or didnât need to because they made very little), could get a check. With the December bill, Republicans could have added a prisoner ban to the legislation before it came to an up-or-down vote. The issue of prisoners and stimulus checks had long been in the news. Earlier in the year, the IRS blocked CARES Act payments to prisoners. That prompted a class action lawsuit on behalf of incarcerated people, arguing that the IRS rule was arbitrary and unlawful. In October, a federal judge ruled against the IRS and said the government had to issue the checks. The  judge ruled  that the CARES Act had no language restricting payments to prisoners, and the administration couldnât invent one. That only applied to the CARES Act, but the point is, Republicans had ample opportunity to grapple with the issue as the December bill was being written. Despite having the right to stimulus checks, many prisoners hit a  stumbling block : The IRS sent the inmates debit cards that some states couldnât process.Â  Cotton said Democrats voted to give stimulus checks to people in prison. They did, arguing that to do otherwise would harm the families of prisoners. Itâs worth noting that Cotton and other Senate Republicans voted for previous relief packages that also resulted in prisoners getting checks.Â  With that clarification, we rate this claim Mostly True.",3/9/21,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/mar/09/tom-cotton/yes-democrats-voted-send-stimulus-checks-prisoners/,1,,Bernie Sanders just voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison
"Says U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner âvoted five times against protecting pre-existing conditions.""",Did Ann Wagner vote to repeal pre-existing conditions protections?   Wagner has voted against the Affordable Care Act numerous times.     She also has co-sponsored alternative legislation that would protect those with pre-existing conditions even if the Affordable Care Act was struck down.,"With the elections around the corner,  Missouriâs 2nd Congressional District  is in the eye of the storm. Democratic challenger Jill Schupp and incumbent Republican U.S. Rep.Â  Ann Wagner are battling for the district that includes parts of St. Louis, St. Charles and Jefferson counties. The Cook Political Report says the race is a  toss-up . In one of Schuppâs attacks in a video on Facebook, Schupp stated: ""Rep. Wagner doesn't want you to know that she's voted five times against protecting pre-existing conditions."" In a time when people with pre-existing conditions are vulnerable, is it really true that she voted against these protections? Letâs take a look. Introduced in 2010, the Affordable Care Act was designed to broaden the reach of health care coverage. In the past decade,  gaps in health coverage  have decreased. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration oppose the law and  have taken steps to repeal the Affordable Care Act . One protection at the core of the Affordable Care Act outlaws denying coverage to those who live with pre-existing conditions. A  pre-existing condition  is a health problem that was around before someoneâs health coverage began.  According to the liberal Center for American Progress,  Missouriâs 2nd Congressional District has more than 320,000 people living with pre-existing conditions. We asked Jill Schuppâs campaign to provide evidence of Wagnerâs votes. Schuppâs communications director Natalie Edelstein provided five unsuccessful attempts by the Republican-led House to repeal the Affordable Care Act while President Barack Obama was in office. These votes are in line with Schuppâs claim. Itâs worth noting that one of the votes is a second vote on the same budget. Also, only one of these is an actual vote to directly repeal the ACA, H.R. 596; the rest are mainly budget votes that cut or redirect funding to the ACA. HealthReformVotes.org , a website that tracks votes concerning health care reform, cites Wagnerâs vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act as unfavorable to consumers.Â  We asked Wagnerâs campaign to comment on this claim. Press secretary Arthur Bryant sent a history of Ann Wagnerâs votes, as well as legislation Wagner has co-sponsored to keep people insured. Here are the votes sent by Wagnerâs campaign from 2019: Alongside colleagues in Congress, Wagner  introduced the Protecting Patients with Preexisting Conditions Act in 2019 . The act would amend the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act to guarantee coverage even if the Affordable Care Act is completely repealed. The  act  also seeks to outlaw discriminatory premium rates. As it stands, the Protecting Patients with Pre-existing Conditions Act  was introduced  a year ago and hasnât been acted on since. Another piece of legislation Wagner co-sponsored,  HR 1066 , aims to keep pre-existing conditions protections in place. Wagner also co-sponsored the  Maintaining Protections with Preexisting Conditions Act of 2018 .  PolitiFact found  that this (as well as  another bill ) has loopholes in denying coverage if companies do not have the capacity to do so. Schupp stated in a Facebook post that ""Ann Wagner doesnât want you to know that sheâs voted five times against protecting people with pre-existing conditions."" Wagner has repeatedly voted for legislation that repealed the Affordable Care Act, which establishes protections for those with pre-existing conditions. If the repeals had been successful, the protections for pre-existing conditions would be gone.Â  Wagnerâs introduction of various bills as alternatives to the Affordable Care Act that would guarantee protections suggests thatâs not the whole story. She has co-sponsored legislation to keep protections in place, but there are loopholes that could jeopardize coverage if the Affordable Care Act was dismantled.

Upton âvoted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditionsâ,Upton voted a dozen times in support of repealing the Affordable Care Act.   Republican Rep. Fred Upton voted four times to repeal the Affordable Care Act and eight times in favor of legislation that called for the health care lawâs repeal.Â      The lawâs protections for people with preexisting conditions and subsidized health care plans have helped to insure thousands of Michiganders.,"Jon Hoadley, a Democrat seeking to represent western Michiganâs 6th congressional district, is attacking his Republican opponent, Rep. Fred Upton, for his voting record on health care. ""He voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,""  an ad  from Hoadley states. The basis of Hoadleyâs attack is Uptonâs consistent opposition to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which barred insurance companies from discriminating â in pricing and coverage â against people with preexisting medical conditions, such as cancer survivors and kids with diabetes as Hoadleyâs ad notes. The ACA also introduced  federal subsidies  for Americans to buy coverage in the individual insurance market and for states to expand Medicaid coverage to  more  low-income Americans. In 2019,  more than 500,000  Michiganders were covered under plans purchased in the individual market, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. And today,  a little more than 800,000  are covered under the ACAâs Medicaid expansion. A repeal or overturning of the ACA, and the loss of its protections, would put that coverage at risk, experts say. In the five years that followed the ACAâs passage, Upton voted 12 times for bills, budget resolutions and amendments that called for repealing the law.Â  More recently, Upton has spoken out against Republican efforts to repeal the ACA without a replacement. ""You simply cannot take what would be millions of people off coverage without a backup plan ready to go,"" he  told  The Detroit News in April 2019. That month, he was one of only eight Republicans  who supported a  resolution  urging the Trump administration to end its effort to overturn the ACA. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments next month on a case supported by the administration asking the court to invalidate the law. Hoadleyâs claim includes recovered COVID-19 patients among those whose coverage would be at risk, but Uptonâs votes to repeal the ACA came years before the pandemic.Â  Upton spokesperson Josh Paciorek said, ""Fred believes we must forge a bipartisan path to ensure all Americans have access to quality, affordable care while always protecting preexisting conditions."" Nonetheless, Hoadleyâs ad gives an accurate count of Uptonâs votes from 2011 to 2015 and their potential impact.Â  The Hoadley ad cites 12 times that Upton voted to repeal or defund the ACA. Here's how they break down: Under the ACA, millions of Americans buy their health insurance through the individual market or receive coverage through the ACAâs expansion of Medicaid. If the law is repealed or struck down by the Supreme Court, many could  face  higher costs for health insurance, lose automatic coverage or become unable to afford coverage. A New York Times  analysis  says as many as 21 million people would be at risk of becoming uninsured. They would also lose protection under ACA provisions that bar discrimination against people with preexisting medical conditions. President Donald Trumpâs executive orders pledging to preserve these protections have  no legal effect , experts say. About  54 million  Americans had a preexisting condition in 2018 that would likely leave them uninsurable in the individual insurance market if the ACA were repealed, according to a 2019 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That includes 29% â just over 1.7 million â of Michiganders under 65.Â  The implementation of the ACAâs major protections helped insure thousands of Michiganders in the individual market soon after Upton cast his first vote to repeal the law in 2011.Â  By the time the preexisting condition protections kicked in in  2014 , Upton had voted to repeal the ACA four times and supported three budget resolutions that assumed savings from the lawâs repeal.Â  Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation said that votes cast before 2014 may not have led to immediate coverage losses. But she said Congress relies on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office that measure the impact of legislation over the next 10 years.Â  In 2014,  nearly 550,000  Michiganders were insured by plans purchased in the individual market, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates, up 74,600 from the previous year. The number was  511,700  last year. In mid-2014, Michiganâs expanded Medicaid program covered  roughly 58,000 . Today, it covers more thanÂ 800,000.Â  An analysis this year from the nonpartisan Center for American Progress estimates that repealing the ACA would  result  in 827,000 Michiganders losing their insurance. A Hoadley ad statesÂ that Upton ""voted a dozen times to kick thousands of Michigan families off their health insurance and eliminate protections for preexisting conditions,"" citing his votes to repeal or defund the Affordable Care Act. Four of those votes were for legislation that would have repealed the law. The eight other votes cited by the campaign laid the groundwork for repealing the ACA, but would have required additional action from lawmakers. Repealing the ACA would have jeopardized health coverage for Michiganders covered under plans purchased in the individual market and the stateâs Medicaid expansion program.

Abigail Spanberger and other Democrats âvoted to spend public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million...â,"Did Spanberger, other House Democrats, vote to use public money for their campaigns?","Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger wants the public to pay for her campaign, according to Nick Freitas, her Republican challenger this fall. ""Washington Democrats love to spend your money,"" says a  Freitas TV ad . ""They even voted to spend public public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million each for travel expenses, staffers, even TV ads. And Abigail Spanberger voted with them, not you."" The ad flashes grainy videos of three Democrats often targeted by conservatives:Â  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. It ends with videos of Spanberger. The narrator says, ""Washington Democrats and Abigail Spanbereger: They flood your TV with attack ads; you get stuck with the bills."" We fact checked whether Spanberger voted to give politicians up to $5 million for their campaigns. A similar claim against Spanberger was made last month in a  TV ad  by the conservative Congressional Leadership Fund. The charge is cropping up in ads against incumbent Democrats in races across the country. The ads target votes that Spanberger and other House Democrats cast on March 8, 2019 for the "" For the People Act of 2019 ,""Â  a 705-page bill that would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, strengthen ethics rules and reduce the influence of private donor money in politics. Spanberger was among  236 Democrats  who cosponsored the measure. It passed the House on a starkly partisan  234-193Â  vote , with all participating Democrats supporting it, and all participating Republicans voting no. The bill has not been taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate. Campaign financing proposal The bill would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations ($200 or less), and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give to their favored candidates for Congress. Freitasâ ad gives the impression that everyone running for federal office would get public funding, but thatâs not the case.Â  Participation in the program would be optional. A candidate would have to agree not to accept any single contribution of more than $200, and any aggregate donations from an individual or PAC of more than $1,000. Each of those contributions, and voucher money, could receive the 6-to-1 match. To qualify for the program, a candidate would have to raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals. Ray La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has told PolitiFact that the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others. ""My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,"" he said. ""They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign."" ""Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,"" he added. ""Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors."" Freitas and other Republicans say the bill would allow up to $5 million in public financing for a candidate. The figure comes from a  Bloomberg Government estimat e in January 2019. Who pays for the funding? Freitasâ ad tells viewers ""you get stuck with the bill,"" suggesting the general public would pay for the matching funds. Thatâs not correct. The money actually would come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect a 2.75 percent surcharge on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. It should be noted, however, that the source of money for the matches was not specified in the version of the bill that Spanberger and other Democrats co-sponsored on Jan. 9, 2019. The fines against banks and corporations were  added to the bill  on March 5. The final bill seals off the possibility that individual and household taxpayersâ money would seep into the fund. It says if the Freedom From Influence Fund runs out of money, no money can be drawn from other sources. The bill allows payments for vouchers and grants to be reduced if the fund runs low. Our ruling Freitasâs ad says Spanberger and other Democrats ""voted to spend public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million...""Â  The claim refers to votes Spanberger and 233 of her Democratic House colleagues cast on March 8, 2019 for a bill that would provide a 6-to-1 match on small-dollar contributions to congressional candidates. Bloomberg News estimates candidates could receive as much as $5 million apiece in federal support. Although the bill would be a step towards public financing of congressional campaigns, Freitas glosses over some important details: Freitasâs statement tells half the story, and we rate it Half True.

"Says ""David Schweikert took over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against legislation to lower prescription drug prices.""","Arizona House race attack ad zeroes in on prescription drug prices.   Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., voted against a Democratic bill that told HHS to negotiate drug prices with drug makers, and pressured drug makers to limit price increases to the rate of inflation.     Schweikert backed a Republican bill that capped out-of-pocket drug costs for Medicare recipients, and promoted the entry of cheaper generic drugs to the market.     Independent analysts say the Republican bill would have a limited impact on drug prices.","Handicappers rate the House race in Arizonaâs 6th Congressional District  as a toss-up , with the edge going to the Republican incumbent, David Schweikert.Â  The high cost of prescription drugs resonates in retiree-heavy Arizona and a major union backing Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in the race has taken Schweikert to task for his voting record on the issue. ""David Schweikert took over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against legislation to lower prescription drug prices,"" an  Oct. 7 Facebook ad  from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said. Schweikert did get that much money from the pharmaceutical sector in his time in office. And he did vote against a major Democratic bill that outside analysts said would push down drug prices. On the other hand, Schweikert backed a Republican bill that would have insulated millions of Medicare recipients from out-of-pocket costs, without doing as much to drive down drug prices.Â  In this fact-check, we look at how both bills tackled rising prices, and whether protecting some patients from higher costs is the same as reining in underlying prices themselves. We made several efforts to connect with Schweikertâs staff and did not hear back. According to the  Center of Responsive Politics , since 2011, Schweikert received $124,902 from the pharmaceutical/health supply sector. His support grew from a low of $10,100 in the 2014 election cycle, to $39,102 in the current one. The industry went from being Schweikertâs 26th largest donor in 2012, to being his eighth largest today. In December 2019, the House passed the  Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act  on a largely party line vote. (No Democrats voted against the bill and only two Republicans voted for it.) Under the billâs most sweeping element, the government would negotiate with drug companies on the prices of as many as 250 drugs. Those prices wouldnât simply apply to government insurance programs like Medicare. Private insurers could use them, too. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that in the course of 10 years, this would reduce government spending by  $456 billion . The CBO left no uncertainty over the billâs impact. ""The lower prices under the bill would immediately lower current and expected future revenues for drug manufacturers, change manufacturersâ incentives, and have broad effects on the drug market,"" the  CBO told Congress . The CBO also estimated that the revenue reductions would have an impact on the drug industry. Overall, it would stand in the way of between eight and 15 new drugs coming to market over the decade. The drug industryâs leading trade group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, vigorously  opposed  the Democratic bill, warning of "" devastating "" effects on drug innovation and jobs in the pharmaceutical sector. The bill also pressured drug makers to reduce prices on many drugs covered by Medicare. If the price of a drug had gone up faster than inflation, the company could either cut the price, or pay a rebate to Washington. The Republican bill â the  Lower Costs, More Cures Act  â did not include either of those two Democratic elements. But the two parties found something approaching common ground on the topic of capping out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients, although the levels of the caps differed. The Republicans capped out-of-pocket costs at $3,100, and the Democrats capped them lower, at $2,000.Â  There were a number of other elements in both bills, but these three pieces capture the bulk of the moves that would directly affect what people pay for prescription drugs. Hereâs a summary: Schweikert  voted against  the Democratic bill, and was one of  147 co-sponsors  of the Republican bill. From the point of view of anyone on Medicare facing the high cost of prescription drugs, a cap on out-of-pocket costs would deliver welcome relief. Both the Republican and Democratic proposals  would help   millions of  people.Â  Both bills would insulate Medicare recipients from the highest costs, said University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill health care policy professor Jonathan Oberlander, but itâs reach is limited. ""A cap can of course provide meaningful help to those who spend large amounts on medications,"" Oberlander said. ""But it doesnât help those subject to high prices whose total spending is still under the cap."" Georgetown University professor Jack Hoadly said, ""Help with out-of-pocket costs does not address drug prices."" ""It simply transfers more of the cost to either the government or the drug plan,"" Hoadly said. ""Eventually those costs will come back to beneficiaries in higher premiums."" The Republican bill did include some elements that indirectly could keep prices lower. It aimed to stop drug makers from abusing patent protections and blocking the entry of cheaper generic drugs. ""Over time that could have an impact on prices,"" said Washington University in St. Louis law professor Rachel Sachs. In contrast, Sachs said, the Democratic bill targeted drug prices directly with impacts that went beyond Medicare beneficiaries. ""Either through negotiating with the drug makers or discouraging them from raising prices faster than inflation, that would touch a broad cross section of Americans,"" Sachs said. The Congressional Budget Office analysis gave an idea of how much money taxpayers would save on prescription drugs under the Democratic bill. The CBO did not do a similar analysis of the Republican measure.Â  But analyst Juliette Cubanski at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care policy data, said if the CBO had scored the Republican bill ""it would definitely have gotten a much smaller savings estimate.""Â  ""HR3 (the Democratic bill) included more provisions than HR19 (the Republican bill)Â  to cap drug price increases and attempt to lower prices overall,"" Cubanski said.Â  A Facebook ad from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees said Schweikert got over $120,000 from the drug industry and voted against a bill to lower prescription drug prices.Â  Schweikert received $124,902 from the drug and health products industry since he entered Congress. He voted against a bill that would have had a significant impact on drug prices and was projected to cut industry revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. He backed a bill that would insulate millions of Medicare recipients from high out-of-pocket costs. According to multiple independent assessments, that alone would not drive down prices. Some measures in the bill could reduce some drug prices over time through competition from generic drugs.

"Says Doug Jones ""has voted to spend our tax dollars on late-term abortions"" and ""supports abortion up until birth.""",Tommy Tuberville wrong twice in attack on Alabama Sen. Doug Jones on abortion.   Jones has not voted for federal funding of âlate-term abortions.â     Jones supports laws that allow abortions beyond a certain number of weeks in order to protect the health of the mother.,"In a campaign  ad  for Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville, a woman speaks into the camera to attack Democratic Sen. Doug Jones over abortion. The self-described ""proud pro-life mother of two"" says she regrets getting an abortion after an unexpected pregnancy at age 18.Â  ""I asked God for forgiveness, and Doug Jones should do the same,"" she adds. ""Jones has voted to spend our tax dollars on late-term abortions. Heâs so extreme, he supports abortion up until birth."" Both parts of the attack are wrong.Â  Tuberville is a former college football coach making his first run for public office. Jones, an attorney, won his Senate seat in December 2017 in a high-profile special election against Republican Roy Moore, after Republican Jeff Sessions vacated the seat to become President Donald Trumpâs first attorney general. The outcome of the Alabama contest could help determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. The race is  rated  as ""lean Republican"" by the Cook Political Report â meaning the race is competitive but the GOP has an advantage. It is  one of 18 pivotal House and Senate  contests that PolitiFact is tracking this fall. In the ad, Tuberville offers no evidence for his claim that Jones voted to spend tax dollars on late-term abortions. In an email to PolitiFact, his campaign, he cited a January 2019 vote by Jones on a bill tightening restrictions on funding and health insurance coverage for abortion. The bill  would have imposed permanent and stricter limits on federal funding of abortions, and barred coverage for abortion in health insurance plans that meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.Â  Jones  voted no  on a motion to proceed with the bill. In a 48-47 party-line vote, the motion fell far short of the 60 needed to advance.Â  Jones opposed the bill because it ""went further than the Hyde Amendment,"" Jones campaign spokesman Owen Kilmer said. It ""would have prohibited individual states from allowing citizens to have access to certain insurance plans that would have covered abortion procedures consistent with that stateâs law."" The Hyde Amendment, routinely attached by Congress to health funding bills,  prohibits  the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the womanâs life. (Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden now  says  he wants to get rid of the Hyde Amendment.) Jonesâ campaign said he supports the Hyde Amendment in its current form and has never voted to spend tax dollars on late-term abortions. Jonesâ no vote on the motion was not a vote to spend federal money on abortions.Â  The phrase Tubervilleâs ad invoked, ""late-term abortion"" is not a medical, scientific or legal term. Like "" abortion up until birth ,"" it is often invoked by abortion opponents to refer to pregnancies terminated after about 20 weeksâ gestation. Such abortions are rare, and subject to restrictions in most states. In the 2017 Alabama Senate special election, Mooreâs wife, Kayla, made a similar attack against Jones, claiming he supported ""full-term abortion."" We rated it  False , noting that she had apparently coined the term herself.Â  At the time, Jones said he supported laws that allow abortions after 20 weeks or so of gestation to protect a motherâs life or health. In the email to PolitiFact, Tubervilleâs campaign cited an  exchange  between Jones and then-MSNBC host Chuck Todd in 2017: Todd:  ""So, you wouldn't be in favor of legislation that said, ban abortion after 20 weeks or something like that?"" Jones:  ""I'm not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman's right and her freedom to choose. That's just the position that I've had for many years. It's a position I continue to have. But I want people to understand that once that baby is born, Iâm going to be there for that child. Thatâs where I become a right-to-lifer."" But Jones also said this in 2017: ""I fully support a woman's freedom to choose to what happens to her own body. Having said that, the law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That's what I support. I don't see any changes in that."" The Supreme Courtâs 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade recognized a womanâs constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy, but it also allowed states to restrict abortions â including banning them altogether â after the point of fetal viability, except when the life or health of the woman is at stake, Darren Hutchinson, a law professor at the University of Florida, told PolitiFact. He said that case did not specify a precise time for viability, but 24 weeksâ gestation has widely been used in medicine and law. Jones  continues  to support laws that allow abortions beyond a certain number of weeks in order to protect the health of the mother. Jones was asked this year by an Alabama newspaper: ""What restrictions, if any, do you support on abortion? Does a woman have a right to an abortion in the case of a medical emergency or a pregnancy caused by sexual assault?"" In his response, published Oct. 12, 2020, Jones  wrote : ""Your question is essentially the stateâs existing law, which allows for an abortion in the case of a medical emergency or a pregnancy caused by sexual assault, which I support. I oppose late-term abortions, which are extremely rare, except for instances of rape, incest, or when the life and health of the mother is in jeopardy."" Tuberville said Jones ""has voted to spend our tax dollars on late-term abortions"" and ""supports abortion up until birth."" Neither part of the claim is accurate.Â  Jones voted against advancing a bill that would tighten existing limits on federal funding for abortion and add new restrictions, but he supports the Hyde Amendment â which prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest, or if the pregnancy is determined to endanger the womanâs life â as it stands.Â  He says he opposes ""late-term"" abortions, except for instances of rape, or incest or to save the motherâs life â the same exceptions as in the Hyde Amendment.

Says Martha McSally âvoted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall.â,"Kellyâs claim that McSally voted to take money from Arizona military base needs context.   McSallyâs votes in 2019 allowed a national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to continue.Â      The resolutions she voted on did not explicitly ask whether to divert money from Fort Huachuca to construction of a border wall; but allowing Trumpâs declaration to persist did have that effect.Â      Funding for the Arizona project was deferred, not scrapped entirely.","Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Mark Kelly told Arizonans that while border security is important for their state, his opponent was going about it the wrong way. Seeking to unseat Republican Sen. Martha McSally, Kelly said that McSally supports a border wall that is too costly and a ""17th century solution"" for border security. The federal government should invest in technology and more border patrol agents â and not take money away from a military base in Arizona, he said. ""Senator McSally voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall,""  Kelly said  during a debate with McSally in Phoenix Oct. 6. Is that true? McSallyâs votes in 2019 allowed a national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to continue. The resolutions she voted on did not explicitly ask whether to divert money from Fort Huachuca to construction of a border wall; but allowing Trumpâs declaration to persist did have that effect. Funding for the Arizona project was deferred, not scrapped entirely. Citing an ""invasion"" crisis, Trump in February 2019  declared  a national emergency at the southwest border, a move that led his administration to redirect funds from planned Defense Department projects to construction at the border. ""Because of the gravity of the current emergency situation, it is necessary for the Armed Forces to provide additional support to address the crisis,""  Trumpâs declaration said . Trumpâs declaration came after he was unable to get money from Congress to pay for his promised border wall. Many immigration experts and lawmakers  questioned  the existence of the crisis Trump cited.. In September 2019, the Defense Department released the  list of projects  it would delay to provide $3.6 billion for border barriers. The list included a  $30 million project  for an equipment storage building at Fort Huachuca, an Army installation in Arizona. The Defense Department  said  at the time that the projects were being deferred, not canceled, and that the $3.6 billion came from ""unobligated"" funds, meaning that the money for the military projects had not yet been committed in contracts. A contract for the Arizona project was expected to be awarded May 2020. Congress would need to backfill the money being diverted, the Defense Department said. Kellyâs campaign pointed to three votes McSally cast in 2019 supporting Trumpâs declaration. McSally in March  voted  against a  resolution  seeking to end Trumpâs national emergency declaration. In September, she  voted  against another similar  resolution . In October, McSally  voted  against overriding a  Trump veto  of a resolution to end his declaration. McSallyâs September and October votes were cast after the Defense Department publicly released the list of projects that would be sidelined, including the one at Fort Huachuca. The resolutions that McSally voted against were specific to Trumpâs declaration and did not include a direct reference to the delayed Defense Department projects. However, the deferral of the projects was directly tied to Trumpâs declaration. McSally in March 2019  sent a  letter  to the acting defense secretary, asking that military construction projects in Arizona not be delayed due to shifts in funding for the border projects. ""While I strongly agree we must be tough on border security to protect Americans from drugs and criminals flowing across our southern border, we cannot forsake one duty for another,"" McSally wrote. McSally said that Arizona military construction funding ""authorized and appropriated in recent years will enable the service members working in critical missions to have a safe, efficient, and effective working environment. Without funding for these projects on schedule and on budget, we risk disruption or degradation of several important military missions."" In September 2019, after the Defense Department included the Fort Huachuca project in its deferred list, McSally  said  that funding for the Arizona project was already delayed anyway, ""because of ongoing environmental cleanup that is taking longer than expected."" ""The fact of the matter is that had the Army completed this sooner, the project would not have been delayed and would not have even been up for discussion,"" McSally said Sept. 4, 2019. McSally said she got a commitment from the Army that the project would be completed ""in a timely manner."" McSallyâs campaign told PolitiFact that the Army in April 2020  notified  her that the Arizona project site had been cleared and that a contract would be awarded at the end of December 2020. Her campaign said the Pentagon had ""reshuffled money around to backfill the money."" The Arizona Republic in April  reported  that the Trump administration restored money for the Arizona project by taking money from the Pentagonâs budget for operations in Europe and the Middle East. ""The money maneuvers are necessary as part of the military budget is redirected to pay for construction of President Donald Trumpâs long-promised border wall,"" said the Arizona Republic article. Kelly said McSally ""voted to take away money from Fort Huachuca to pay for the border wall."" This needs context. McSally voted against resolutions that sought to end Trumpâs national emergency declaration. Trumpâs declaration paved the way for the Defense Department to identify military projects that would be deferred â including a $30 million project at Fort Huachuca â in order to free up money for construction of barriers at the southwest border. McSally in early 2019 asked the Defense Department to not delay funding for Arizona projects in order to pay for the border barriers. Later that year, she said the Fort Huachuca project was delayed anyway due to environmental cleanup issues at the site. Kellyâs statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"Says âLucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists.â","Lucy McBath didnât vote to release murderers, rapists from prison.

The 6th District rematch is  one of 18  pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.Â  In the ad, the camera follows a woman jogging in a park, with heavy breathing in the background audio. A narrator says, ""We moved here for peace of mind, safety, but now crime has gotten out of control, and Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison. Murderers, rapists.""Â  Handel is running a campaign reminiscent of President Donald Trumpâs push for ""law and order,"" and she previously released an  ad  that accused McBath of being soft on crime and supportive of violent protesters, which  we rated False .Â  The NRCC ad is consistent with this attack line. But we found that it leaves out important context and gives a misleading impression.Â  The adâs fine print cites McBathâs vote for H.R. 6800, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill that did not become law. McBath voted with other House Democrats in favor of the measure, one part of which mandated the release of prisoners vulnerable to COVID-19. However, another provision in the bill explicitly bars the release of prisoners deemed to be a risk for violence.Â  H.R. 6800, known as the HEROES Act, is a  proposed bill  meant to respond to various aspects of the COVID-19 crisis. The bill, which passed the House but stalled in the Senate, would provide $3.4 trillion of coronavirus relief, including assistance to state and local governments and hazard pay for frontline health care workers. The part thatâs relevant to the NRCCâs claims come from a 44-page portion of the 1,800-page bill. This section was written to address the fact that prison inmates have  been among those hardest hit  by the pandemic. It requires the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service to place into home confinement prisoners who are within a year of being released, juveniles, pregnant, over 50 years old or have health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, HIV, or cancer. The bill specifically bars the release of inmates deemed to be a risk for violence. It does not define that criteria. Hereâs language  directly  from the bill: The Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshal Service ""may not place in community supervision any individual if the court determines, after a hearing and the attorney for the Government shows by clear and convincing evidence based on individualized facts, that detention is necessary because the individualâs release will pose a specific and substantial risk that the individual will cause bodily injury or use violent force against the person of another.""Â  The NRCC didnât respond to our request for comment. However, a  document  posted on its website notes that ""the vague language of H.R. 6800 does not rule out the release of violent prisoners.""Â  By raising the issue of  rising crime  in Georgia and referencing McBathâs vote for the HEROES Act in a single breath, the ad seems to be implying that the legislation has contributed to rising crime in McBathâs district.Â  However, the HEROES Act hasnât been enacted, so it canât be linked to any crime trend.Â  In addition, the ad leaves out the important context that the bill doesnât call for inmates to be released into the general public.Â  ""People are not being sent home from jail,"" said Kanya Bennett, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, summarizing the billâs intent. ""Theyâre being sent to home confinement and still under the supervision of the Bureau of Prisons. Thatâs a very important distinction to make.""Â  A campaign ad claims that ""Lucy McBath voted to release criminals from prison.

Says Joe Cunningham voted for $5 million in taxpayer funds to go into his and other politiciansâ campaigns to pay for personal expenses and TV ads.,"SC Rep. Cunningham did not vote for $5M in tax funds to go to campaign coffers.   The vote was for a bill that would provide, with restrictions, federal matching funds for House and presidential campaigns, with a limit of $5 million per qualified House candidate.     The funds would not come from taxes, but rather from a fee added to civil and criminal fines.     Separately, the bill also would allow candidates to use campaign funds for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance.","Nancy Mace, the Republican challenger in a House race in South Carolina, parlayed a debate question about high-speed internet into an attack on Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham. ""We canât get funding and resources for rural broadband if weâre sending and voting for $5 million that you voted for, to go into your campaign coffers to pay for your ...personal expenses, that pay for your TV ads,"" Mace charged. ""All those things â $5 million. Well, whoâs going to pay that bill? The taxpayers."" Maceâs campaign said she was referring to Cunninghamâs vote for HR 1, called the ""For the People Act,""  a bill  under consideration that would establish an alternative campaign funding system for House and presidential offices.Â  Her attack is a mixed bag: An eligible House candidateâs campaign could receive a maximum of $5 million in federal funds â and that comes with restrictions. The funds would not come from a tax, but rather from a fee added to criminal and civil fines, and court settlements. Separately â and unrelated to the billâs matching funds provisions â the legislation would allow candidates to use campaign funds for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance. The race pitting Mace, a state representative since 2018, against first-time House member Cunningham is  one of 18  pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. The Cook Political Report rates the match-up as  ""lean Democratic,""  meaning the race is competitive but Cunningham has an advantage. HR 1 , introduced in January 2019, is a  sweeping  bill that would make changes to laws aimed at making it easier to vote, increasing election security and improving campaign finance transparency. It passed the House in March, with all Democrats voting yes and all Republicans voting no. No action has been taken in the GOP-controlled Senate. A service used by GovTrack.us, which tracks Congress, gives the bill a  4%  chance of becoming law. The provision Mace zeroed in on would use public financing to provide House and presidential candidates with matching funds for six times the amount of campaign donations of up to $200. So, for every $200 in these smaller donations, the federal government would pay $1,200 to the campaign.Â  But  not all  candidates would be allowed to receive matched donations. To be eligible, a candidate would have to raise $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals during the qualifying period, and they would have to agree to accept no contributions larger than $1,000.Â  The total matching funds available to any individual candidate would be  limited  to  $5   million . The matching funds  would not  come from a tax but, based on an amendment to the original bill, from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury. It would collect funds from a 2.75% fee assessed on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. The bill would also  allow  the use of campaign funds for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance. But that  exception  would not apply to incumbents such as Cunningham. Generally, campaign funds can be used for advertising, among other expenses. Mace said Cunningham voted for $5 million in taxpayer funds to go into his campaign coffers and politicians like him ""that pay your personal expenses, that pay for your TV ads."" Cunningham voted for a bill that would pay federal matching funds to House candidate campaigns â but it would not be automatic and would not necessarily come to $5 million. In order to receive the matching funds, candidates would need to meet certain requirements that limit the size of the donations they accept. And the maximum match under any scenario would be $5 million. The funds would not come from a tax, but from a fee assessed to criminal and civil fines. A separate provision would allow challengers, but not incumbent candidates like Cunningham, to use campaign funds generally to pay for certain personal expenses, such as health insurance.Â  We rate the statement Half True.

Nick Freitas âvoted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy. â,Did Nick Freitas vote against job protections for pregnant workers?,"A large union is claiming Nick Freitas, the Republican candidate for the 7th Congressional District seat, has turned his back on working pregnant women. ""He voted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy,"" says a  TV ad  by the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters Vote! PAC.Â Â  Â Â The ad began airing Sept. 15. It shows a doleful pregnant woman, who seemingly worked at a convenience store, hanging up her apron, dropping her name badge in a trash can, and walking out into the rain. We fact checked the adâs statement. The PAC says itâs based on Freitasâ vote on March 3 against successful  legislation  that gives job protections to pregnant women and new mothers working for small companies. The bill - now law - bans the small companies from firing, denying promotion or otherwise discriminating against an employee solely because she is pregnant or has a condition related to her pregnancy. It requires employers to make ""reasonable accommodations"" for the worker, including seating, light duty assignments, leave to recover from childbirth, and a private place other than a bathroom to pump breast milk. Violators can be sued. The bill passed the Senate unanimously. It cleared the House on a largely partisan vote. Although Republicans did not debate the bill or express objections, 38 of 45 GOP delegates - including Freitas - quietly voted against it. After the ad hit TV, Freitas explained his vote during a Sept. 22  podcast . He said the bill was superfluous because federal law already protects pregnant workers from job discrimination. ""Itâs already a law; you canât fire someone because they are or can become pregnant. Thatâs sufficient,"" he said. ""Democrats were adding all this additional bureaucracy and all these rules on top of that."" Freitas said he was concerned that the additional laws might discourage employers from hiring women. ""I donât want to put women at a competitive disadvantage,"" said Freitas, who noted he was mostly reared by a single mother. ""I want them to have these opportunities."" Freitas is inaccurate, however, in saying the new state law merely bans what was already illegal.  Federal law  protects women against ""pregnancy-based discrimination and harassment at work"" only if they have jobs at companies with 15 or more employees. Virginiaâs law offers protections to an additional group of women - those working at companies with 6-14 employees. The group covered by the new state law is relatively small, but statistics are not available to exactly define it. The closest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show 14.9% of all Virginia workers in March were employed by companies with 5-19 employees. The data is not broken down by sex, age or the smaller 6-14 employee range covered by the law. Our ruling Â Â  The United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters PAC says in a TV ad that Freitas ""voted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy. "" Freitas voted against a bill - now a law - to bar small companies from firing or discriminating against an employee because she is pregnant or has a condition related to her pregnancy. But this was not a sweeping bill as the ad suggests by offering no other details. The legislation protects pregnant workers at companies with 6-14 employees. The vast majority of women work for companies with 15 or more employees and were already protected by federal law.Â  So the ad claim is accurate, but needs elaboration. We rate it Mostly True.",10/5/20,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/05/united-associations-union-plumbers-and-pipefitters/did-nick-freitas-vote-against-job-protections-preg/,1,,Nick Freitas voted to let businesses discriminate and fire expecting mothers for no other reason but their pregnancy
Says House candidate Jon Hoadley voted to defund the police,"Fred Upton campaign ad says Jon Hoadley voted to defund the police. Thatâs not true.   An ad for Rep. Fred Uptonâs re-election campaign features a sheriff claiming that Uptonâs Democratic challenger, Jon Hoadley, voted to defund the police.     Hoadley voted against a state House resolution discouraging local governments from defunding or abolishing their police departments. The resolution did not propose increasing or decreasing spending for local law enforcement.Â      Hoadley has talked about the importance of criminal justice reform but he has not called for reducing spending on policing.","A  television ad  from incumbent U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., attacks his Democratic challenger, state Rep. Jon Hoadley, for a vote he cast in June in Michiganâs House. ""Hoadley voted against law enforcement, siding with defund the police, making families less safe,"" the narrator in the ad claims. The ad features Berrien County Sheriff Paul Bailey, who claims that ""what Hoadley did to vote to defund the police was wrong."" But Hoadley didnât vote to defund the police. Uptonâs ad cites Hoadleyâs Jun. 17 vote against a  resolution  adopted by the Michigan House that discourages local governments in Michigan from defunding or abolishing their local police departments. Resolutions offer the Legislature a way to state its priorities, but they are nonbinding. The resolution did not propose to increase or decrease funding for local police departments, whose budgets are determined at the local level. Bailey stands by his claim that Hoadley voted to defund the police. ""It is concerning when Jon Hoadley â who sits on the Appropriations Committee â talks about how frustrating it is that âeverything but police got cutâ or how important it is to discuss âreprioritizing parts of our budget.â Then, just weeks later, he chooses to vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from defunding or abolishing their police departments,"" Bailey said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan. Bailey was referring to remarks Hoadley made during a  June 12 event  organized by Mothers of Hope, a community organization based in Kalamazoo, during which Hoadley was asked about his position on defunding the police. ""It is frustrating that everything but police got cut whenever there was a question â was the pile big enough? So I think itâs important weâre having this conversation now about reprioritizing parts of our budget,"" Hoadley said. ""It's clear to me and in the eyes of law enforcement â his vote was a vote to defund the police,"" Bailey added. Josh Paciorek, communications director for Uptonâs campaign, told PolitiFact Michigan in an email: ""Weâre taking law enforcementâs view on this one."" The phrase ""defunding the police"" has come to refer to  a range of policies , from redirecting some funding toward community development initiatives to dismantling police agencies altogether. It has served as a shorthand rallying cry for activists demanding police reforms, as well as a political cudgel for conservatives seeking to paint liberals as soft on crime. Hoadley said he did not vote to defund the police. ""I voted against an inaccurate resolution that was attempting to score political points, not solve problems,"" he said in a statement to PolitiFact Michigan. ""Many of my colleagues spoke to the need to vote ânoâ on the resolution and continue the real work on criminal justice reform, racial justice, and properly supporting public safety so both officers and residents are more secure."" The resolution Uptonâs ad refers to was introduced by Republican state Rep. Ryan Berman and  passed  with support of all 58 House Republicans and 21 House Democrats. Hoadley was among the 29 Democratic members of the House who voted against the resolution. Berman explained that he introduced the resolution as a kind of referendum on calls to defund or abolish police departments. ""The notion of outright defunding police departments is dangerous, and Iâve tendered this resolution to take a stand against it,"" said Berman on the House floor. The resolution did not propose increasing funding for local law enforcement departments. While Berman and Hoadley took different positions on the resolution, they agreed on one thing: The COVID-induced economic recession has created fiscal challenges for local governments that could affect police budgets. ""With potentially massive budget shortfalls facing us due to COVID-19, I imagine it will be even tougher for departments financially in the coming years,"" Berman  said  on the House floor. In a  statement  explaining his vote, Hoadely agreed with Bermanâs assessment but argued that that the resolutionâs intent would strip local governments of the flexibility they need to respond to budget shortfalls. ""We cannot opine from the floor of the statehouse on what local communities should or (should) not spend their dollars on while not offering solutions,"" said Hoadley, adding: ""How do you tell your local firefighters that potentially half of you are going to have to get laid off but, thatâs OK because this resolution thought that police departments shouldnât be subject to the same budget realities as everyone else?"" Paciorek, from the Upton campaign, argued that Hoadleyâs acknowledgement of the fiscal constraints facing local governments â including police â was inconsistent with his vote. ""Why would he vote against a resolution that discourages local governments from stripping even more resources from police services?"" he asked. Hoadley criticized the resolution as a way of shutting down debate around police reform, but he did not say that funding for police should be reduced. A campaign ad from Upton says Hoadley voted to defund the police. In June, Hoadley voted against a resolution discouraging local governments from reducing their police departmentâs budgets or abolishing their department. He cited the need to continue discussion about criminal justice reform and to give local governments flexibility to make spending decisions. He did not vote to reduce spending on law enforcement.

"Says Sara Gideon ""voted to defund"" the Freeport police ""and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run.""","Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins lobs false âdefund policeâ attack on Sara Gideon.   As a town council member, Gideon voted to consolidate police dispatch services with a neighboring community, saving the town money.     Gideon didnât give town funds to the nonprofit for which she served as a board member. She joined in a town council vote to forgive part of a loan to the nonprofit, a move unrelated to the dispatch consolidation.","Some top Republicans who have alleged that top Democrats want to defund the police have fared poorly on our Truth-O-Meter. We rated  False  President Donald Trumpâs claim that Joe Biden wanted to defund the police. And an attack by U.S. Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., against her Democratic challenger, Mark Kelly, caught  Pants on Fire . Now comes a more targeted attack in another pivotal Nov. 3 race, the Senate contest in Maine pitting Republican Sen. Susan Collins against Democrat Sara Gideon.Â  Collins alleges in  an ad  that Gideon ""voted to defund"" the police in the Maine town of Freeport ""and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run."" Both parts of this defund claim fail, too: Collins cherry-picked a Gideon vote for consolidating Freeportâs police dispatch services with a neighboring townâs, resulting in savings to Freeport. Gideon didnât give money to the nonprofit for which she served as a board member. Unrelated to the dispatch issue, she joined in a town council vote to forgive part of a loan to the nonprofit. Collins  has been a senator since 1997.  Gideon  has served in Maineâs state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. She served as a Freeport Town Council member from 2009 to 2013.Â  Many   news   accounts  say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. The Cook Political Report has rated the race a  tossup . It is  one of 18  pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. Police departments generally allocate most of their budgets to salaries, and whatâs left over is used for equipment, training and community-oriented programs. In the  movement  to defund police, some activists want to eliminate police departments entirely, while others want to reexamine the functions of police departments and redirect some of their funding to other community services. But the Collins ad misused the term ""defund"" to describe a budget move thatâs not related to that movement at all. A vote to save money on policing isnât necessarily defunding the police. Gideon has stated â at a debate, in a clip used by the ad itself â that, like  Biden , she does not support defunding the police. Gideon was part of a 5-2 majority on the Freeport Town Council that voted in May 2010 to fully consolidate police dispatch services with another town, Brunswick, saving an estimated $73,750 in Freeportâs 2011  budget .Â  Brunswick was  already  handling the dispatch for Freeportâs 911 calls; the 2010 vote added non-emergency dispatch. The vote didnât change the number of police officers on the streets. Gideonâs campaign cited minutes showing Gideon voted for annual town budgets that raised police funding. The 2013 town budget provided $192,000 more in police funding â totaling the general police, special enforcement and police dispatch accounts â than the 2010 budget, which was in place when she took office. The point being: Freeport police budgets increased â not decreased â while Gideon was a member of the town council. To back the second part of the claim in the ad, Collinsâ campaign charges that Gideon, ""after taking funding from the police department,"" voted four months later to provide about $70,000 in aid to Freeport Community Services, a nonprofit for which she was a board member. Gideon helped with projectsÂ but was not involved in the day-to-day operations, which were managed by an executive director, a Gideon campaign spokeswoman said. Gideon, who noted at the meeting that she was on the board, joined with the majority of the town council in September 2010 in a 4-0 vote, with one abstention. The vote was to  forgive  part of a loan that had been given to Freeport Community Services. The meeting minutes indicate that in approving the vote, the town would forgive $65,000 in debt if the nonprofit raised $65,000. The aid to the nonprofit was unrelated to the discussion of police budgets. Sen. Collins says in an ad that Gideon ""voted to defund"" the police in Freeport, Maine, ""and gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run."" Gideon voted to consolidate Freeport dispatch services with another town, saving money. But she actually voted for higher police budgets as a town council member. So the Collins ad misuses the term ""defund"" to describe moves that are unrelated to the ""defund police"" movement.Â  The claim that Gideon gave the money to a nonprofit she helped run is even more spurious. Her vote to aid a nonprofit she served on the board of involved a forgiven loan and was unrelated to the police. The proposal passed the council 4-0. We rate Collinsâ statement False.

"""When California faced a budget crisis,"" Christy Smith ""voted to lay off teachers and then voted to increase her pay.""","Attack ad exaggerates Christy Smith votes to lay off teachers, raise her own pay.   As a member of the Newhall School Board, Smith votedÂ in 2012 to lay off teachers and in 2013 to notify teachers of possible layoffs. She also voted soon after those moves to rehire for nearly all of the positions.     California school districts often send notices of possible layoffs to teachers early in their budget cycle, while the state budget picture remains unknown. The notices can be rescinded once the budget situation is clarified.     Smith joined in a 5-0 vote to raise the $250 monthly stipend of Newhall board members by $12.50.","A  TV ad  attacking California congressional candidate  Christy Smith  portrays the former school board member as being anti-teacher. ""When California faced a budget crisis,"" it says over menacing music, ""Smith voted to lay off teachers and then voted to increase her pay."" The ad is referring to votes that Smith cast more than six years ago during her nine-year tenure as a local school board member. However, the ad lacks context and tells only part of the story. Her votes ultimately led to the layoff of only one permanent teacher. Smith did vote once to raise the $250 monthly stipend of school board members by 5%. The ad is from the Congressional Leadership  Fund , a super PAC that works to elect Republicans to the House. Smith, a California assemblywoman elected in 2018, is running against Republican Rep. Mike Garcia on Nov. 3 for the  25th District  congressional seat, north of Los Angeles.Â  Garcia , a former military pilot,  defeated  Smith in a special election for the seat in May. That election was held to replace Democrat Katie Hill after she resigned. The race is  one of 18  pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. It is rated a  tossup  by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. The ad  alludes  to May 2012, when Californiaâs governor announced that the state budget deficit was $16 billion, much wider than the $9 billion that had been estimated four months earlier. State officials were  preparing  to make further budget cuts to schools and other programs. The ad cites three votes Smith took on the Newhall School Board, on which she served from 2009  until  her election to the Assembly in 2018. Asked for evidence of the adâs claims, the Congressional Leadership Fund provided PolitiFact with what appear to be screenshots of portions of the minutes from three Newhall School Board meetings. PolitiFact obtained the full minutes for those votes and related votes. May 2012: The board voted 5-0 to lay off 17 temporary elementary school teachers and two permanent physical education teachers. Within two months, the board took two more votes â both 5-0 with Smith in favor â resulting in all of the temporary teachers being rehired and one of the physical education teachers being brought back full time and the other part time. So, the total loss was one-half of a physical education teacher position. March 2013: The board voted 5-0 to notify 26 temporary teachers of possible layoffs; and voted 3-1-1, with Smith abstaining, to lay off one permanent music teacher. The minutes don't state why Smith abstained, but they say current and former students and parents expressed concern about the effect on the music program of losing the position. Sixteen temps were rehired three months later, with Smith joining in a 5-0 vote for the rehiring. Marc Winger, who was the Newhall superintendent at the time and is now Smithâs campaign treasurer, said California law requires school districts to issue notifications of possible layoffs and that such notifications, which can be rescinded without layoffs being done, are common when districtsâ finances are uncertain early in the year. The Newhall district sent possible layoff notices to temps even though their contracts were only for one school year, ending June 30, he said. When Smith served, the only compensation Newhall school board members received was a monthly stipend, though they could also opt to purchase health insurance through the school district, Winger said. On Dec. 9, 2014, the board voted 5-0 to approve ""an allowable 5% increase to their current monthly stipend,"" the minutes said. No other details were given. Winger said the stipend before the vote was $250. The vote raised the stipend by $12.50 per month.Â  In response to a similar attack from the National Republican Congressional Committee, Smithâs campaign put out a  statement  in April from the president of the California Federation of Teachers that says the union is supporting her campaign. The campaign also cited awards Smith received from the California Teachers Association union  in January . The Congressional Leadership Fund said: ""When California faced a budget crisis,"" Smith ""voted to lay off teachers and then voted to increase her pay."" Smith voted in 2012 to lay off 17 temporary elementary school teachers and two permanent physical education teachers. Within two months, however, she also voted in favor of rehiring all of the temporary teachers, and one of the physical education teachers. The second physical education teacher was brought back part time. A vote she took in 2013 was to notify temporary teachers of possible layoffs. Smith did vote in 2014 for a $12.50 increase in a monthly stipend for board members, their only compensation. The statement about Smithâs votes on teacher layoffs ignores the fact that Smith also voted to rehire all the teachers, ultimately only losing a half of a position. And the claim about Smithâs vote on pay leaves out the fact that the increase amounted to $12.50 per month, important clarifying information.

The 6th District rematch is  one of 18  pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking. Handel  served in the House  from  June 20, 2017, to Jan. 3, 2019, after winning a special election to fill the remainder of the term ofÂ  Tom Price, who resigned. She is the former chairwoman of Fulton County (Ga.) Board of Commissioners and the former secretary of state of Georgia. McBath  defeated Handel in Handelâs bid for re-election in November 2018. McBath became a gun-control  advocate  after the shooting death of her teen son in 2012. McBathâs ad alludes to the American Health Care Act, a  Trump-supported  Republican bill that would have  repealed  and replaced the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).Â  The bill, which did not become law, was approved by the House, with only GOP votes, in May 2017.Â  That was before the special election that put Handel in the House. As a candidate, Handel did  say  Obamacare needed to be repealed and replaced. She  called  the House vote a good first step. It goes too far to say the bill would have been gutting health care. The bill would have  retained  Obamacare provisions such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage for a pre-existing health problem, although subsidies to keep insurance affordable would have been reduced dramatically. The ad also alludes to an August 2018  incident  on the House floor over the Trump administrationâs policy to separate children from their parents at the southern border. With Handel acting temporarily as the House chair, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., played a recording of children crying in a detention center. Handel asked him to stop, citing a House rule that forbids the playing of electronic devices. She banged the gavel and ordered him to stop several times, but he continued playing the recording for several minutes. Handel had expressed opposition to the policy two months earlier, however,  saying:  ""We must find a more humane, compassionate approach â one that keeps families together to the fullest extent possible â as U.S. immigration authorities determine appropriate next steps."" Handel did  vote  in October 2017 for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act ,  backed  by Trump, which would have made it a crime to perform an abortion ""if the probable post-fertilization age of the fetus is 20 weeks or more."" It passed the House but did not become law. McBathâs ad gets some details wrong in saying that when Handel was in the House, she voted with Trump, ""gutting health care for millions, supporting horrific child separation policies"" and for ""abortion bans."" Handel supported repealing Obamacare, but a House vote on a Republican replacement bill occurred before she took office.

The image cites SB 311, the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act ,Â which would establish requirements for the care that practitioners must provideÂ to an infant born after a failed abortion attempt, and include possible prison time for anyone who doesnât meet the standards.Â  Many Democratic senators have said they do not support the bill, and most of them voted to block its progress through the Senate.Â  The effect of their vote was not to allow practitioners to let doctors and parents to leave babies to die, but to preserve the legal status quo, which already considers infants to be humans protected under the law.Â  When this Aug. 18 post was made, the Senate had not brought the bill to the floor for a final vote.Â  The senators listed in the post are those who voted no on a cloture motion, a procedural proposal that would have moved it toward a final vote in the Senate.Â  There have been two failed cloture votes on the bill so far, one in  February 2019 Â and one in  February 2020 . During the first vote, 44 Democratic senators voted no, and on the second, 41 voted no. All 53 Republicans voted in favor of the motion both times.Â  A cloture vote needs 60 votes to pass, so the bill stalled in the debate stage.Â  The image in the Facebook post lists 44 names, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who were absent during the second vote. (Sanders is an independent in the Senate). However, the caption above it references ""41"" who voted no. In either case, the image mischaracterizes both the content of the bill and the effect of the Democratic senatorsâ votes.Â  Under SB 311, health care practitioners must treat a baby born after an attempted abortion as they would any other newborn, and immediately admit the child to the hospital. A person who violates these terms would be subject to criminal penalties, including a fine and/or up to five years of prison. A person who kills an infant after a failed abortion would be subject to prosecution for murder.Â  Senate Republicans cast the bill as ""anti-infanticide legislation,"" describing it as a simple choice between leaving infants to die or protecting them under the law. ""Everyone in the Senate ought to be able to say unequivocally that killing that little baby is wrong. This doesn't take any political courage,"" the billâs sponsor, Ben Sasse, R-Neb.,  said  on the Senate floor.Â  Some Democrats called the bill a case of government overreach that took decisions out of the hands of parents and medical professionals. They noted that it would apply to a small number of abortions that involve complex and difficult factors that often canât be anticipated, such as cases where the motherâs life would be at risk or where an infant has been born with a terminal disease.Â  According to  the Guttmacher Institute , 43 states have banned ""some abortions after a certain point in pregnancy."" In 2016, procedures performed in the 21st week of gestation or laterÂ  accounted Â for 1.2% of all abortions. Deaths involving babies born alive after an attempted abortion are even rarer. A  report  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that looked at death certificates for infants from 2003-2014 showed ""143 deaths involving induced terminations"" during that 12-year period. Of these deaths, 97 involved a ""maternal complication, or one or more congenital anomalies.""Â  However, the CDC report acknowledged that this number could be an underestimate due to vague wording on some death certificates.Â  Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), whose name is included in the Facebook post, said the legislation ""would force doctors to perform ineffective, invasive procedures on fetuses born with fatal abnormalities â¦ even if itâs against the best interests of the child.""Â  Most of the billâs Democratic opponents  explained  their votes by noting that existing federal law and most statesâ laws already provide protections for babies born alive after abortion attempts.Â  Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., for example,  cited  the murder conviction of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 for killing live-born infants after botched abortions at his Philadelphia clinic. Prosecutors in the case  cited a Pennsylvania state law  that says a baby delivered during an abortion and showing signs of life is considered alive, according to the New York Times.Â  Snopes  found  that 34 states currently have laws that explicitly affirm a duty of care forÂ  infants and enforce penalties for failing to provide that care.Â  At the federal level, the  Born-Alive Infants Protections Act , which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2002, defined ""born alive"" infants as human persons, subject to the same legal protections as any other child. Under this definition, anyone who kills an infant after a failed abortion can be prosecuted for murder, and health care practitioners are obligated to provide the same level of care they would give to any other infant.Â  But the 2002 law did not explicitly set out any federal penalties for health care practitioners who donât provide such care, beyond those now in effect in 34 states. SB 311 would set a uniform standard for all 50 states.Â  Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University, told PolitiFact that even in the 16 states that do not lay out an affirmative duty of care, leaving a baby to die would be considered a murder by omission. ""If you had an elderly adult and you decided to starve them to death, that would be a homicide. Once a child is born alive, the same rules apply to them,"" said Ziegler.Â  SB 311 would come into play only during the rare and extremely complex cases where the facts of an attempted abortion are disputed.Â  ""When you have an alleged infanticide, itâs a he-said-she-said situation, where an abortionist says that an infant was not born alive and prosecutors said she was,"" Ziegler said. ""Many of these cases end in mistrials because the jury simply doesnât know what took place.""Â  The bill would make these prosecutions easier by placing responsibility for an infantâs health more squarely on the abortionist.Â  A viral image says that 41 senators voted ""to let babies scream until they die if born alive,"" paying special emphasis to Harris.Â  The image mischaracterizes the votes that have been conducted on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protections Act and the effect of the legislation on protections for infants born following abortion attempts.Â  In voting against cloture, Democratic senators didnât vote to roll back protections for live-born infants but rather to keep them as they are. So the Facebook postâs claim that their vote allowed parents and doctors to let infants ""scream until they die"" exaggerates the effect of their vote.Â  We rate this post False. â",9/1/20,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/01/viral-image/facebook-post-mischaracterizes-democratic-senators/,1,,Kamala Harris voted to let babies scream until they die if born alive

Rand Paul advocated for President Donald Trumpâs re-election by portraying him as someone who wants to end wars and casting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as someone ""who consistently called for more war."" ""Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation,"" Paul said Aug. 25 during the second night of the Republican National Convention. ""I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya."" Is the senator from Kentucky right about Bidenâs record? Biden voted for a resolution that paved the way for the Iraq War, and for a non-binding resolution to authorize military air operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The conflicts in Syria and Libya happened when Biden was vice president and followed the policies of President Barack Obama. This checks out. In 2002, President George W. Bush  argued  that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a  resolution  that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. In a Senate floor  speech  before voting for the resolution, Biden said that ""failure to overwhelmingly support"" the resolution was ""likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur."" The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. He left open the possibility that Hussein might ""miscalculate"" and ""misjudge"" U.S. resolve. In that event, use of military force might be needed, Biden said. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. In 2005, Biden was asked i n an interview  if his 2002 vote was a mistake. ""It was a mistake,"" Biden answered. ""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. â¦ We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan."" RELATED :  Trump still wrong on his claim that he opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion Serbia : Biden voted for a  1999 concurrent resolution  authorizing President Bill Clinton to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. (Concurrent resolutions express the sentiment of Congress, but are not signed by the president and do not carry the force of law.) Clinton in March 1999  ordered air strikes  in response to Yugoslaviaâs campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. The  Kosovo conflict  erupted in the 1990s  between two groups within the former Yugoslavia â Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups long disputed the territory known as Kosovo. After greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Paulâs office referenced conflicts in Syria and Libya that started in 2011, when Biden was vice president. Syria : Syrians began protesting their government in  early 2011 , calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved. The United States since 2011 has called for Syriaâs President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. The Obama administration in 2014 launched air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015 deployed troops there to fight the terrorist group. Bidenâs campaign said the Obama-Biden administration supported the Syrian opposition in a variety of ways, including by deploying U.S. forces to combat ISIS. Libya : The United States, as part of a NATO operation, provided air support in an intervention that resulted in the ouster of the countryâs longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi.  Obama said  Gadhafi was launching military actions that were causing civilian deaths and forcing ordinary Libyans to escape to neighboring countries, threatening a humanitarian crisis within Libya and instability for its neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia. The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gadhafi. The uprising â part of the Arab Spring â toppled Gadhafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him that October. Paulâs office sent us as a  2011 fact-check  of Biden as evidence for his support of the U.S. intervention. In that fact-check, we examined Bidenâs claim that in Libya, ""America spent $2 billion total and didnât lose a single life."" We rated that Mostly True. (The fact-check did not focus on Bidenâs own position on the issue.) Bidenâs campaign, however, pointed to a  2016 Politico report that referenced an  interview Biden gave to journalist Charlie Rose in which he said that intervening in Libya was wrong. The Politico story said that Biden told Rose that he had ""argued strongly"" within the White House ""against going ... to Libya."" Politico reported that Biden in that interview also said the United States should not use force unless the interests of the country or its allies are directly threatened, whether it can be done ""efficaciously"" and whether it can be sustained. Paul said Biden, ""Voted for the Iraq war â¦ He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya."" Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).

Sen. Steve Daines âvoted to give billions in tax breaks to big drug companies even as they raised prices.â,"Misleading ad in Montana Senate race casts Steve Daines as soft on drug companies.  Daines voted for major tax legislation that lowered taxes on corporations and many individuals. It did not specifically benefit drug makers.Â   As a senator, Daines has voted for bills that seek to reduce prescription drug prices.","Money is pouring into Montana as outside groups seek to influence the U.S. Senate race between Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock and Republican Sen. Steve Daines. One of these groups on the Democratic side skewers Daines in a Facebook  ad  for being generous to Big Pharma.Â  ""Daines voted to give billions in tax breaks to big drug companies even as they raised prices,"" the ad claims. The ad was made by Duty and Honor, a nonprofit affiliated with the Democratic-backed Senate Majority PAC. To maintain its nonprofit status, Duty and Honor canât endorse a particular candidate. But in running ads harshly critical of Daines, itâs clearly trying to hurt his re-election chances.Â  The ad gives a misleading impression that Daines voted for a tax break tailored to big drug companies. The adâs fine print gives us a clue about what Daines really voted for: the Republican-backed tax law signed by President Donald Trump.Â Â  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 made the  largest single reduction  in the corporate tax rate in U.S. history. It lowered taxes on corporations, small businesses, and most Americans. The law also reduced taxes on overseas profits, and it allowed overseas profits from earlier years to be repatriated after a one-time charge.Â  Daines joined Republican senators in  voting  for the final version of the tax plan. No Senate Democrats supported it. The ad doesnât mention the benefits of the law for small businesses and the average taxpayer. At the same time, the bill did give ""big drug companies"" billions of dollars in tax breaks.Â  Pharmaceutical companies profited from the drop in the overall corporate tax rate. And since  10 of the top 30  companies with the biggest offshore holdings are biopharma companies, they also benefited disproportionately from the favorable treatment of repatriated overseas profits. Biopharma Dive, a business journalism outlet,  reviewed  regulatory filings of the 11 biggest drugmakers and found that the tax law shrunk their payments by nearly $4 billion. The ad claims that Daines helped the drugmakers while they were raising prices.Â  ""In general, companies have continued to raise list prices for brand name drugs faster than inflation,"" Stacie Dusetzina, associate professor of health policy at Vanderbilt, told PolitiFact. However, this does not necessarily mean that prices have gone up. Drug prices fluctuate based on availability and the types of rebates pharmacy benefits managers negotiate.Â  On average, list prices â the cost that wholesalers pay to manufacturers â went up 7% in 2018. Prices after rebates and discounts (net prices) went up 2.1% that year. The numbers  indicate  that prescription drug prices increased overall the year the tax cuts passed. The ad also doesnât mention that Daines supports legislation aiming to reduce the price of prescription drugs. In 2019, Daines  voted  in committee for the bipartisan  Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act , which seeks to drive down drug prices through rebates. In an email interview, Duty and Honor spokesperson Matt Corridoni acknowledged that Daines has voted to lower drug prices, but noted that he ""voted against multiple amendments in committee that would have made the legislation stronger in terms of going after the drug companies on pricing."" The Daines campaign didnât respond to our request for comment.Â  The ad claims Daines ""voted to give billions in tax breaks to big drug companies even as they raised prices."" Daines voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered tax rates and provided billions in tax relief to powerful drug companies. The missing context from the ad is that the law did not single out those companies in particular. Rather, it reduced taxes for the vast majority of Americans, small businesses, and the corporate sector.

Says Rep. Elissa Slotkin âvoted against condemning cyber attacks by the Chinese Communist Party on American organizations developing COVID-19 treatments.â,"Fact-check: Junge says Slotkin voted against condemning Chinese cyberattacks. Thatâs not true.   Hackers linked to China are launching attacks on American companies and institutions working to develop a treatment for the coronavirus, federal officials have warned.     Slotkin voted to take up consideration of an infrastructure bill rather than allowing an amendment that would have forced the House to consider a resolution on sanctioning Chinese cyberattacks to be offered. She didnât vote against the resolution.     Slotkin later voted for a failed amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021  authorizing sanctions against foreign actors conducting cyberattacks on organizations and individuals engaged in coronavirus research.","Paul Junge, the Republican nominee running to unseat incumbent Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, wrote a  Facebook post  criticizing Slotkin for failing to support action on Chinese cyberattacks targeting American companies and researchers working to develop vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus. ""She voted against condemning cyber attacks by the Chinese Communist Party on American organizations developing COVID-19 treatments,"" Junge  claimed . Slotkin, a former national-security aide to presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, won election in 2018 in a traditionally Republican district in Southeast Michigan. She is fighting a challenge from Junge, a former prosecutor and TV anchor. Junge is referring to a  resolution  introduced by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., condemning the cyberattacks and calling on the administration to punish those engaged in the attacks through sanctions. During debate on whether to take up a major infrastructure bill, Rep. Robert Woodall, R-Ga., attempted to force the House to begin considering Kinzingerâs resolution instead. Thatâs where Slotkin joined Democrats and voted to begin considering the infrastructure bill. Jungeâs claim interprets Slotkinâs vote on a procedural move as a vote against the resolution condemning the cyberattacks. But there was no vote on Kinzingerâs resolution. What did the House vote on? In May, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security  issued  a  public warning  that hackers linked to China are engaged in cyberattacks to steal information from American research institutions and pharmaceutical companies working to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Russian hackers are also  attacking  universities, companies and other entities working conducting research on a coronavirus vaccine, federal officials have warned. Kinzinger, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, responded to these warnings with a resolution condemning the attacks. The House has yet to take a vote on it. President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have stepped up their attacks on China as they hone their messages for the fall campaign. On June 30, the House considered a  resolution  to take up the  Moving Forward Act , a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill authorizing funds for federal highway, road safety and transit programs. The bill includes  $300 billion  for fixing roads and bridges and provides funding to states to expand broadband access. It also includes several water-quality provisions of particular interest to Michiganders, including reauthorizing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. During debate on the House floor, Rep. Robert Woodall, R-Ga., promised to offer an amendment that would have forced the House to immediately consider Rep. Kinzingerâs resolution condemning Chinese cyberattacks. The House then took a vote on whether to end debate on taking up the infrastructure bill. In this case, voting against ending debate would have delayed consideration of the Moving Forward Act and allowed Rep. Woodall to offer his amendment to consider Rep. Kinzingerâs resolution. New York Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle, who introduced the resolution to consider the Moving Forward Act,  noted  his support for ""any resolutions on Chinese and Russian interference in American activities,"" adding, ""the work in front of us, however, is a $1.5 trillion transportation bill desperately needed for American citizens throughout this country."" The House cast a party-line vote to begin debating the Moving Forward Act, which passed the next day and is awaiting a vote in the Senate. As a result of this vote, Kinzingerâs resolution did not come up for consideration that day. Junge, as well as stories from  The Washington Free Beacon  and  The Federalist ,  claimed that the Houseâs vote was a rejection of Kinzingerâs resolution. Slotkin ""voted against considering a condemnation of Chinese cyber attacks,"" said Rob Wagener, Paul Jungeâs campaign manager. She ""could have demonstrated some of the moderation she promised"" by voting against moving forward with a debate on the infrastructure bill ""but she didnât."" Slotkinâs campaign defended her move to keep the infrastructure bill on track. ""There is no reason to choose between confronting China's malign cyber activity and fixing our roads and bridges,"" said Gordon Trowbridge, Slotkinâs campaign spokesperson. Soon after the Free Beacon and Federalist reports, Slotkin was among only 14 Democratic lawmakers to  support  returning the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021  back to the Committee on Armed Services to add an amendment authorizing sanctions against foreign actors conducting cyberattacks on organizations and people engaged in coronavirus research. The motion failed, and the law  passed  the House without any such amendment. Our ruling Junge claimed that Slotkin ""voted against condemning cyber attacks by the Chinese Communist Party on American organizations developing COVID-19 treatments."" Slotkin did not vote for or against the Kinzinger resolution to condemn Chinese-linked cyberattacks. That resolution did not come up for a vote. The vote was on moving forward with consideration on an infrastructure bill. Weeks later, she voted for a measure authorizing sanctions for cyberattacks on coronavirus researchers, but it did not pass. Jungeâs post is not accurate.

"Says Susan Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makersâ and denied taking campaign money from a family who made its wealth selling OxyContin.","Fact-checking an attack on Sen. Susan Collins over opioids, campaign donations.   Collins voted against one measure that would have punished opioid manufacturers and their executives because she said it was overly broad.Â      She also voted for measures to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for the distribution of suspiciously large orders of drugs and for drug diversion.     Collins did say no when asked if she had taken campaign money from members of the Sackler family that owns the company that makes OxyContin. She received one contribution â $2,300 in 2007 â from one family member.","The opioid addiction crisis, along with the  billions  earned by the maker of OxyContin, are being invoked in a race that could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate. The target is four-term GOP incumbent Susan Collins of Maine. The attack comes from Senate Majority  PAC , which works to elect Democrats to the Senate. Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers"" and ""lied"" when she said she didnât take campaign money from a family who made its wealth selling OxyContin, the political action committee claims in a  TV ad . The claim misleadingly cherry-picks one Collins vote.Â  But while being videotaped in 2020, Collins did deny taking any campaign funds from the family, when she did receive one donation in 2007. Collins  has served in the Senate since 1997. Her opponent Sara  Gideon  has served in the Maineâs House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. With polls showing a tight contest, the Cook Political Report has rated the race a  tossup . Many   news   accounts  say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. Purdue Pharma  began selling OxyContin , a slow-release pill based on the pain reliever oxycodone, in the mid-1990s and heavily promoted it. Between 1991 and 2011, the number of opioid prescriptions, as well as the number of opioid-related deaths, nearly tripled. Since 2000, four opioids â oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin and fentanyl, a synthetic â have killed more than  400,000  Americans. That includes nearly  15,000  people who suffered fatal overdoses from prescription opioids in 2018, the latest year for those figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Purdue Pharma is  seeking   bankruptcy  protection as part of an effort to settle nearly 3,000 lawsuits brought against it by state, local and tribal governments that blame the company for sparking the opioid crisis. The company's settlement plan calls for the members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay at least $3 billion and give up ownership of Purdue. The PACâs 30-second ad starts by citing a figure for the number of opioid pills ""pushed to Maine"" by opioid distributors and how much money opioid distributors have given to Collinsâ campaign. Then it says Collins accepted campaign money from Jonathan Sackler (who  died  of cancer on June 30.) Senate Majority PAC cited a donation of  $2,300  that Sackler made to Collinsâ campaign in 2007. Then comes the two parts of the ad weâre checking. Claim No. 1.  Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers."" The reference is to Collinsâ vote in a Senate committee against a failed amendment, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018.Â  Sanders  said  his amendment would have imposed retroactive fines on companies and executives and set new punishments for future activities.Â  Collins campaign spokesman Kevin Kelley, noting that three Democrats on the committee also voted no, told PolitiFact that Collinsâ concern was the amendment ""was written so broadly that anyone involved in a transaction could have been implicated.""Â  Kelley cited instances in which Collins voted to hold opioid companies accountable, including  voting  for a  2018 law . One provision in that law aims to hold drug distributors and manufacturers accountable for stopping delivery of drugs on suspiciously high orders by pharmacies and stopping the diversion of drugs. A  2016 law  she voted for requires any new drug application for an opioid to be referred to an advisory committee for recommendations prior to FDA approval. Claim No. 2.  Collins ""lied"" about campaign money This part of the ad features a video clip, recorded in January, showing Collins on an airplane having a conversation with a woman who is not visible: Woman: ""Your campaign has taken money from the Sacklers?""Â  Collins: ""From the Sacklers? No, I have not."" Woman: ""Never?"" Collins: ""Never."" Collins did not know she was being videotaped and was thinking about donations for the current campaign when she answered the question, Kelley said. ""But, to be more accurate, the senator has said that she should have said that she does not recall receiving such a donation,"" he said. The woman in the conversation is Amy Halsted, co-director of the Maine Peopleâs Alliance, according to a January  article  by MaineBeacon.com, which is a project of the alliance. The alliance is a progressive grassroots group. The article includes video of the full six-minute conversation. An attack ad claimed Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers"" and ""lied"" when she said she didnât take campaign money from a family who made its wealth selling OxyContin. The first part of the claim is misleading. On holding manufacturers accountable, Collins voted against one measure that failed, but voted for several others that became law.Â  When asked if she had ever taken campaign money from the Sackler family, Collins said no, and was wrong.

A new ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee saysÂ Cal Cunningham, North Carolinaâs Democratic Senate candidate, voted to raise taxes by $1 billion. In 2001, Cunningham was a state legislator when the state faced an estimated budget shortfall of about $800 million. Records show the budget signed into law and supported by Cunningham included more than $1 billion in new taxes and fees.","A new ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee attacks the voting record of North Carolinaâs Democratic Senate candidate. Incumbent Republican Thom Tillis hopes to fend off a challenge from Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state legislator. The new NRSC  ad  references Cunninghamâs time at the legislature in Raleigh. ""Cunningham voted for over $1 billion in new taxes,"" the narrator says, adding that the higher taxes were applied to ""sales, healthcare, alcohol and more."" In an email to PolitiFact, the NRSC cited several news stories from 2001. That year, North Carolinaâs legislature and Gov. Mike Easley approved a  state budget  that raised taxes and fees to generate $1 billion over two years, according to clips from the Charlotte Observer and News & Observer. At the time, North Carolina was the only state to raise personal income tax rates, a budget analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures told the News & Observer for a Sept. 22, 2001 article. The budget included a half-cent sales tax increase, bumping the rate from 4% to 4.5%. It also raised the tax on telecommunications services from 4.5% to 6%, and applied a 6% sales tax on liquor. It also included a half-percentage-point increase in income tax on the wealthy for tax years 2001 and 2003, the N&O reported. Cunningham has  defended the vote , saying it helped North Carolina preserve its financial standing during uncertain times. Campaign spokesman Aaron Simpson said Cunninghamâs efforts helped save jobs. ""In the face of an $800 million budget shortfall, Cal voted to increase teacher pay, establish pre-K, and reduce class sizes, while also helping families by providing a larger tax credit per child,"" Simpson said. In an Aug. 10  interview with WLOS , Cunningham said ""I think that was the right budget for North Carolina."" We asked local think tanks what they thought of the 2001 budget decisions. As you might expect, the liberal North Carolina Justice Center and the conservative Civitas Institute offered different views. Brian Balfour, executive vice president at Civitas, agreed that North Carolinaâs credit rating ""likely would have been threatened"" if lawmakers hadnât balanced the budget. ""The consequence of a credit downgrade would mean that it would be more expensive for the state to borrow money. The effect would be higher debt service payments, meaning that budget writers would either have to find places to cut spending or raise revenue to account for the higher debt payments,"" Balfour said. Civitas would prefer lawmakers cut spending.Â  Old news clips provided by the Justice Center show they believed lawmakers were wise to raise taxes to generate funding instead of using ""one-time fixes"" like draining the stateâs rainy day fund. The Justice Center also estimated that most taxpayers, on average, would face state and local tax increases of less than 2.25% of their incomes. But both the Justice Center and Civitas agreed that the budget included what they referred to as ""regressive"" taxes, meaning they disproportionately hurt the lower class. They listed the statewide half-cent sales tax as an example. Balfour estimated that the sales tax cost North Carolinians $645 million over the biennium --Â  $246.3 million in the first year and $398.7 million in the second.Â  ""Compare this to the new tax bracket imposed on married filers above $200k, which was estimated to collect $228.4 million over the biennium,"" he said.Â  The NRSC ad says ""Cunningham voted for over $1 billion in new taxes.""

Says Ron Johnson and 36 other senators âvoted for federal agencies to have access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant.â,"Did U.S. senators vote to allow access to your internet history without a warrant? Not really.   There was a vote against requiring warrants, but it was to maintain the status quo, not create a new access requirement.     This authority is nothing new. Itâs been allowed for 20 years in foreign intelligence investigations, and is also allowed in basic criminal investigations -- all without a warrant.     The vote referenced here applied only to Americans ârelevantâ to counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigation.     Though a warrant isnât needed, investigators still must get a court to sign off on the internet data access.","A viral Facebook post says Americans missed a big moment in privacy rights. Some provisions of the 2001 Patriot Act â which greatly expanded government intelligence gathering in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks â expired earlier this year amid GOP gridlock. The legislation has drawn criticism over the breadth of surveillance it enables, particularly after classified documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed phone record metadata collected on a massive scale. The U.S. House reauthorized the three lapsed intelligence programs in March 2020, and the U.S. Senate passed its own version May 14 â making changes that sent the bill back to the House. Before final passage, though, the Senate by the narrowest of margins defeated an amendment that would have limited access to internet browser and search histories. This drew the ire of one Libertarian group, whose May 14, 2020,  Facebook post  on the subject has been shared almost 10,000 times. This post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Facebook ). The post from Being Libertarian named the senators who opposed the amendment â including House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Wisconsinâs Ron Johnson, both Republicans â and said this: ""Here's the list of senators who sold out your freedoms. They all voted for federal agencies to have access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" But this statement is misleading in its simplicity. Access isn't as easy or widespread as that implies â or even a new thing. The statement implies this was a vote to enable internet history access without a warrant, but the government has actually been able to do that for nearly 20 years. That was among many powers granted by the 2001 Patriot Act. Section 215 can be used to compel third parties (such as internet service providers) to produce information related to intelligence investigations (not law enforcement investigations). This has long been considered compatible with the U.S. Constitutionâs  Fourth Amendment  protection against unreasonable search and seizure, since the Supreme Court has said since the 1970s that protection does not apply to records held by third parties, according to  Robert Chesney , director of the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin. He noted this interpretation is now ""under pressure,"" but still in place. Section 215 allows government investigators to obtain internet browsing history or search queries, but there are several limitations, Chesney said. For an American, this can only be used to obtain web history related to a counterterrorism or counterintelligence investigation. (For a foreign person, any foreign-intelligence purpose can justify access to online history.) The request must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, made up of  11 federal judges  from around the country. The court was  established by Congress through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  to approve electronic surveillance, physical search, and certain other forms of investigative actions for foreign intelligence purposes. The standard of proof to get such approval under Section 215 is somewhere between a subpoena and a search warrant, said  Stewart Baker , a former general counsel of the National Security Agency who  edited a book  on the Patriot Act. ""Like a warrant, it requires the approval of a court (subpoenas often donât),"" he said in an email. ""But unlike a warrant, the standard for granting access to records under Section 215 is âreasonableâ cause to believe the records are ârelevantâ to a national security investigation."" This is short of the ""probable cause"" standard needed for the court to authorize a wiretap or physical search. The U.S. Department of Justice makes all government appearances in the surveillance court, though they use supporting documentation from the FBI and NSA, Baker said. We should also note the foreign intelligence court has come under fire after recent revelations.Â  A  December 2019 report  from the DOJâs independent watchdog, Michael Horowitz, found ""at least 17 significant errors or omissions"" in warrant applications related to Carter Page, Donald Trumpâs campaign adviser. An  ensuing review  in March 2020 of 29 randomly selected wiretap requests revealed the FBI could not locate supporting documentation for four, and the other 25 each contained ""apparent errors or inadequately supported facts."" In 2019, the court received 1,010 applications for investigative action, of which it granted 688, modified 264 and denied in whole or part only 58, according to its  annual report . Itâs not clear how often the federal government has used Section 215 to obtain browsing history,  NBC News reported  on May 15, 2020. They said tech companies are legally prohibited from detailing national security requests they receive. The bill before Congress reauthorizes intelligence gathering that Congress first authorized decades ago through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Senate  passed its version  80-16 on May 14, 2020, after voting down two amendments â one to  prevent surveillance act authority  from being used against Americans and one to prevent the government from  obtaining internet browsing and search history  without a warrant (the one referenced in the claim). One of the sponsors of the warrant amendment, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, called Section 215 ""the most controversial and dangerous provision"" of the surveillance act. ""There is little information that is more personal than your web browsing history,"" Wyden, a Democrat who sponsored the amendment,  told Vox.com  for a May 13, 2020, story. ""If you know that a person is visiting the website of a mental health professional, or a substance abuse support group, or a particular political organization, or a particular dating site, you know a tremendous amount of private and personal. â¦ This level of surveillance absolutely ought to require a warrant."" The measure gathered bipartisan support but fell one vote short of passage,  59-37 . Such amendments require a 60-vote threshold. All of which brings us, finally, back to the claim that 27 Republicans and 10 Democrats in the Senate ""voted for federal agencies to have access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" Firstly, this implies the senators voted to actively allow this, when in fact the vote was against banning it. In other words, they voted to maintain the status quo. The reference to ""your internet history"" implies this is a widespread action allowing some kind of sweeping internet data-gathering, in the vein of the phone datamining Snowden revealed. But Section 215 allows this internet data gathering only in relation to foreign intelligence, international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities investigation. The post also implies unfettered access, when in fact government investigators must get a court to sign off on obtaining this data â even if getting approval requires a lower threshold than a warrant. Finally, the Facebook post leaves readers with the impression this is an unusual allowance. But gathering internet data without a warrant is already widely allowable under basic criminal law. ""Under criminal law, browser history can be obtained if relevant to any criminal investigation,"" Baker said. ""Thatâs probably the best reason not to adopt this (amendment). It makes no sense to say that no warrant or judicial review is needed to obtain such records in an investigation of securities fraud, but one is needed to investigate and try to stop an act of terrorism."" The House and Senate versions of the surveillance act include a provision specifying Section 215 doesnât go beyond what can be used in criminal investigations, Baker noted. It says the government cannot seek an order in circumstances where ""a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes."" The page that created the viral post did not respond to requests for comment, and the libertarian group the post credited as a source declined to provide supporting evidence. A viral Facebook post names 37 senators it says voted to allow ""access to your internet history without obtaining a warrant."" There was indeed a vote against requiring warrants, but the fundamental implication in this post is that it enabled widespread and unrestricted access to Americansâ web activity. And thatâs not accurate. This data can only be obtained for an American after approval from a federal court, and only if it is related to a counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigation. And this authority is nothing new â this power relative to foreign intelligence was granted almost 20 years ago under the Patriot Act. And similar data is accessible without a warrant in standard criminal investigations as well. So weâre left with an element of truth, but a claim that ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Among these benefits is paid sick leave during the government-mandated shutdown of non-essential businesses. Jacobs  voted against the bill . He was one of six senators who voted against it. All of the senators voting against the bill were Republicans serving in the Democratic-controlled chamber. Jacobs issued a  press release  the day before the vote critical of the measure.

""Hypocritical politicians of the day, March 12, 2020,"" stated the  FacebookÂ post , which was  deleted  from Occupy Democratsâ Facebook page after we asked about it.

We found that while the post gets the lawmakersâ votes right, it makes a notable leap when it states that the men took paid sick leave.Â  As members of Congress, they donât have to take sick leave but were able to work from home at their own discretion. Itâs a privilege that many working people donât have.Â  Federal law does not require paid sick leave, but 12  states and Washington, D.C. , have enacted laws to require it, and other  cities  have similar policies.

Gaetz announced his self-quarantine on March 9 and said he would complete it March 12. Gaetz said he took a lab test and that it came back  negative  for COVID-19. Cruz  announced  his self-quarantine March 8. Cruz said he would continue his self-quarantine until March 17. An initial  press release  appears to show Cruz wasnât tested.

News releases from Cruzâs office  during the past several days showed he continued to work on legislation and urged the administration to take certain steps to  track coronavirus cases .Â  Members of Congress can take time off when they are ill and for other excused absences, and they continue to be paid, said Brad Fitch, CEO of the Congressional Management Foundation. But they canât vote remotely. Traditionally, members have entered statements in the Congressional Record after theyâve missed votes, stating how they would have voted if present.Â  So Gaetz and Cruz were working from home, not on paid sick leave. But have they opposed paid sick leave for others?Â  As a Florida state representative in 2013, Gaetz  voted in favor  of  HB 655 , which banned local governments from requiring employers to provide employment benefits, including paid sick time. It passed the Senate 25-13 and passed the House 76-41, and then- Gov. Rick Scott signed it into law . The bill was a response to a petition signed by 50,000 Orange County voters seeking a voter referendum on sick pay. Those against sick leave requirements included the stateâs business lobby, Walt Disney World and Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden). Gaetz  said recently  he opposed the measure because he didnât want local governments making many different rules.Â  Cruz voted against sick leave in 2015, when U.S. senators considered  an amendment  to provide seven days of paid sick leave. Amid efforts to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19, federal lawmakers are again talking about sick leave.Â  The  House passed a bill  March 14 that included 14 daysâ paid sick leave, but it only covers small and mid-sized companies, and it doesnât cover workers who are self-employed. The bill is expected to go to the Senate this week. Vicki Shabo , an expert on paid leave at the New America think tank, said that close to 30% of private-sector workers donât have paid sick leave, and thatâs disproportionally in low-wage service and care industries. While workers who have flexibility or are in positions of power can choose to stay home if they want to, most people donât have job protections or security to be able to do that, Shabo said.Â  A Facebook post by Occupy Democrats said Gaetz and Cruz took two weeks paid sick leave to self-quarantine. Gaetz ""voted in 2013 to make it illegal for any city in Florida to enact paid sick leave"" and Cruz ""voted in 2015 in the U.S. Senate against paid sick leave."" The post correctly notes that Gaetz and Cruz have voted against paid sick leave. But it goes wrong in saying that the two men are on paid sick leave now.

Says Bernie Sanders voted against the auto bailout,"Joe Biden gets Bernie Sandersâ votes wrong on auto bailout.   Sanders voted against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout,Â but the fundsâ primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed.     Sanders voted in favor of a standalone meausre providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed.Â TheÂ standalone measure failed.","As the United States faces economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders argued about their past records on bailouts following the 2008 financial collapse. Sanders said that he voted against the 2008 bailout while Biden supported it. Biden then countered: ""Part of that was bailing out the automobile industry â saving thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs over time. (Sanders) voted against that as well."" Sanders interjected: ""No, I did not vote against that. That bailout money was used later on by Bush to protect the automobile industry."" We found that both Biden and Sanders are only telling part of the story about Sandersâ votes. RELATED:  Bernie Sanders overstates recession aid to Wall Street banks In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion  Troubled Asset Relief Program  (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry. That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry. But the measure  failed  in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to  allocate some of the TARP funds  to General Motors and Chrysler. Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the funds went out to the banks and motor companies. So Sanders had two opportunities to show support on the auto bailout: in December 2008, when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout, and again in January 2009, when members considered blocking TARP funds. Sanders  voted in favor  of the December  separate auto bailout  and against the January measure. After the favorable December vote, Sanders spoke in  an interview  about the value of automobile industry jobs, which he described historically as the ""gold standard for manufacturing workers"" due to the good wages, benefits and strong union. Sanders told  Vermont Public Radio  that he supported the measure because ""I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls."" However, Sanders  voted to block  the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds. (Sanders opposed  the initial TARP bill  in October.) Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed. ""I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,"" he said in a  statement . ""I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression."" Auto companies ended up receiving  about $85 billion  in TARP funds, according to the New York Times. Biden said that Sanders voted against the auto bailout.

The most recent of those votes took place 26 years ago, and in his 2020 campaign, Sanders is fully supportive of expanded background checks and other gun control policies supported by a wide range of Democratic politicians.","Former Vice President Joe Biden went after his presidential campaign rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over gun policy during an interview with NBCâs Savannah Guthrie. Sanders ""voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people,"" Biden  said  in the March 5 interview. The Brady Bill line was also an attack that Sandersâ 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, used, and Biden,  like Clinton before him , is correct about the number of times Sanders voted against the landmark gun law, which among other things would have tightened background check requirements. However, Bidenâs assertion glosses over the fact that Sanders now supports tighter background checks. RELATED:  Bernie Sandersâ complicated record on guns Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermontâs sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted  against  a version that mandated a  seven-day waiting period . The bill passed in the House.Â Â  2. The Senate then voted to decrease the waiting period to  five days , and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted  against  that version. Although it passed in the House, the Senate didnât muster enough votes for the new version. 3. After some back and forth, a bill resurfaced that  reinstated the five-day waiting period . In November 1993, Sanders voted  against  that version  twice  in the same day.Â  4. Sanders voted  against  an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and  for  an amendment giving those denied a gun  the right to know why . 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill âÂ  an  interim five-day waiting period  while installing an instant background check system â was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted  against  it. The Sanders campaign told PolitiFact in 2015 that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. Sandersâ early votes against the Brady Bill reflected his constituentsâ views on guns in the rural state of Vermont. Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on  Amtrak trains  and in  National Parks . ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Sanders aide Jeff Weaver told us at the time. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" In recent years, Sanders has moved closer to an anti-gun position that is more in line with the norms within the Democratic Party. Sanders has voted in favor of  banning assault weapons ,  closing the gun show loophole ,  regulating high capacity magazines , and  expanding background checks , spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in 2015. And over the past 15 years, he has received  mixed marks  from the National Rifle Association, ranging from a C-minus to F. His most recent  pro-gun vote  came in 2009. Early in the 2016 campaign, Sanders sounded something of a middle-ground message, such as  telling  CNNâs Jake Tapper in July 2015 that ""we need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this."" But later in the 2016 campaign, after primary rivals had hit him on his past votes, Sanders sharpened his anti-gun rhetoric and  said he would repeal  the law he previously voted for that blocks lawsuits against gunmakers. In his current presidential campaign, Sanders has made clear his support for tighter gun restrictions. On the  issues page  of his campaign website, Sanders promises to expand background checks, ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, and prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines, among other policies.

"Says U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski âvoted against the DREAM Act, supports separating families and banning Muslims.â",Challengerâs account of Lipinskiâs immigration record falls short. Lipinski did vote against the 2010 DREAM Act. But he has since supported legislation that wouldÂ provide similar protections forÂ immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. He is a longtime critic of a Trump policy that resulted in children being separated from their families along the border and of the presidentâs travel ban affecting people from Muslim-majority nations.,"Critics of U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the last conservative Democrats in the House, often argue he is out of step with what they view as his constituents' more progressive values. The eight-term congressmanâs record on hot-button issues including health care, abortion and immigration has become a central focus in the March 17 primary challenge for the 3rd District seat he now holds. One attack on Lipinskiâs immigration record caught our attention because it suggests the congressman is aligned with some of Republican President Donald Trumpâs most controversial policies. A graphic  tweeted  by challenger Rush Darwish, who runs a multimedia production company in Chicago, said Lipinski ""voted against the DREAM Act, supports separating families and banning Muslims."" The 3rd District is the stateâs most Arab American district,  according to experts . And Darwish, who is Palestinian American,  has said  Lipinski has ignored the interests of immigrant communities there. Lipinskiâs 2010 vote against legislation that would have protected ""Dreamers"" â the nickname for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children â from deportation,  has   been   widely   reported . But we didnât know what Darwish was referencing when he claimed Lipinski backed ""separating families and banning Muslims."" So we decided to find out. Thereâs a lot to unpack in Darwishâs claim, so weâll start with its clearest contention. First introduced in 2001, the DREAM Act not only would have prevented the deportation of Dreamers, but also would have provided a path to citizenship. In 2010, Lipinski was  one of 38 Democrats  to vote against the bill, which passed the House but died  in the Senate . Since then, however, Lipinski has taken steps to protect the beneficiaries of a similar program instituted by former President Barack Obama and has more recently backed new legislation that resembles the bill he voted against. Obamaâs Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, offered Dreamers temporary protection from deportation but did not include a path to citizenship. In 2017, Trump moved to  end DACA . His administration is still required to process renewal applications for immigrants who have been granted DACA and want to renew that protection, but the government is not allowing new applicants to apply. Lipinski signed on to  a letter  that year requesting Trump continue DACA and told  the Sun-Times  he would support legislation to protect the program. And in 2019, he co-sponsored and helped pass  a House bill  to protect DACA recipients. The legislation, which is unlikely to secure Senate approval, would provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and other immigrants with temporary legal status. In April 2018 , Trumpâs Justice Department introduced a ""zero tolerance"" policy that called for prosecuting all adults referred by immigration authorities for violating immigration laws. As a consequence of that policy, children were separated from their parents as they arrived at the border. Lipinski  criticized those separations  at the time and signed on to  several   letters  questioning the governmentâs actions. Last year, he also  co-sponsored legislation  aimed at limiting family separations near the border. But a Darwish spokesperson told us his candidateâs tweet wasnât talking about those separations. ""We are referring to Congressman Lipinski's vote against the DREAM Act,"" spokesperson Andrew Patinkin wrote in an email. ""Lipinski effectively voted in favor of the separation of families because when undocumented people are brought to the United States as children and are not provided a path to legal residency, they may very well be deported."" Even by that logic, Lipinski clearly reversed course on providing legal residency to Dreamers. Shortly after taking office , Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and the U.S. refugee program. Lipinski decried the presidentâs order in  a press release  at the time, calling it ""ill conceived and harmful to innocent individuals."" Instead of pointing to evidence Lipinski supports Trumpâs travel ban,  a version of which was upheld  by the Supreme Court in 2018, Darwishâs spokesman cited the congressmanâs absence from the list of cosponsors for a bill that would limit the presidentâs authority to restrict residents of other countries from entering the United States. When we asked Lipinskiâs campaign if he planned to support the bill, spokesperson Sally Daly told us he intends to vote for it. Daly also said he became a co-sponsor ""this week,"" but did not provide a specific date.  The list  now shows he was added on March 5, the same day we spoke with her. Darwishâs tweet claims Lipinski ""voted against the DREAM Act, supports separating families and banning Muslims."" Lipinski did vote against the DREAM Act in 2010. But he now supports legislation to provide similar protections to immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. He has been a longtime critic of a Trump policy that resulted in children being separated from their families along the border and of the presidentâs travel ban affecting people from Muslim-majority nations. Darwishâs claim contains some truth in citing Lipinskiâs vote against the DREAM Act, but it gives a misleading impression overall of the congressmanâs current stance on key immigration issues. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE  â The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

His party affiliation in Congress is as an independent, but he caucuses with Democrats and is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. When we looked at some of the major war-related votes Sanders has taken, we find that he did vote in support of some of them, but he also voted against others. Hereâs a rundown: Persian Gulf War, 1991 : Sanders  voted against  authorizing the war.Â  Iraq War, 2002 : Sanders  voted against  authorizing the war. War in Yemen ,  2018 : Not only did Sanders vote to end U.S. military support for Saudia Arabiaâs war in Yemen, but Sanders was the  lead sponsor  of the bill. He managed the unusual feat of securing bipartisan support for the measure during the presidency of Donald Trump. Trump eventually vetoed the resolution and the Senate was  unable to override his veto . Bosnia War, 1998 . This measure was for removing military forces after they were already there.

"Says Sen. Thom Tillis voted to ""take away"" coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.","Cunningham says Tills voted to 'take away' coverage for pre-existing conditions. Tillis has repeatedly voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. If those repeal experts had been successful, people with pre-existing conditions could have been left without health care coverage. Tillis later introduced legislation that attempts to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but experts say it doesn't match the ACA's protections.","From Republican U.S. Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the economy under President Trump. From Democratic Senate candidates, voters are likely to hear about the need for better health care policy. Nowhere is that more true than North Carolina, where a handful of Democrats are vying to knock out incumbent Republican Thom Tillis. One of them is Cal Cunningham, who has support from the Democratic Party establishment. The Cunningham campaign recently released an ad accusing Tillis of voting to ""take away"" coverage for pre-existing conditions. The Feb. 5  tweet  says, ""Without coverage for pre-existing conditions, Susie and her family would be bankrupt. Those protections are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away."" Included in the tweet is a video that profiles a mother named Susie who says her daughter has a pre-existing condition. ""Without pre-existing condition coverage, we would be bankrupt,"" Susie says.Â  Cunningham then appears on screen to say, ""Those protections for Susieâs children are exactly what Thom Tillis voted to take away."" Then this text appears over a photo of Tillis: ""Tillis voted against protections for pre-existing conditions."" Is it true that Tillis voted to take away coverage for people with pre-existing conditions? Yes. Tillis voted to repeal a law, the Affordable Care Act, that provides that coverage. While repeal efforts have been unsuccessful, repealing and replacing the ACA has been part of the Tillis platform for years. He voted to repeal the ACA, and later proposed a different law that aims to address pre-existing conditions. But experts say the Tillis plan, along with other Republican proposals, fall short of offering the coverage in the ACA. First, some background. A pre-existing condition is a health problem that someone has before their health coverage starts. Examples include asthma, cancer, diabetes or lupus. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, insurers could deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions or inflate their premiums so much that they dropped coverage, as  PolitiFact  and  its partners  have previously reported. The Cunningham ad specifically mentions a vote from July 26, 2015: the roll call for a vote to allow the repeal of the health care law. You can see from the billâs ""statement of purpose"" that it was meant to ""repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 entirely.""Â  The record shows Tillis voted to repeal it. ""Certainly, this provision, if enacted, would have removed coverage of pre-existing conditions because it would have repealed the ACA in its entirety, which would have restored law to what it was prior to 2010, when pre-existing conditions often were not covered in most states, or by federal law,"" said Mark Hall, a law and health professor at Wake Forest University. PolitiFact has  repeatedly  determined that a vote to repeal the ACA in full would have stripped coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Subsequent GOP-written bills to replace the ACA have not ensured the same level of patients with those conditions. When PolitiFact reached out to the Tillis campaign, spokesman Andrew Romeo didnât dispute Tillisâ vote from 2015.Â  But he claimed Tillis has always supported replacing Obamacare ""with a health care law that retains that critical provision, in addition to ensuring Americans under the age of 26 can stay on their family's health plan,"" Romeo said. He added that Tillis has ""taken steps to ensure that patients with pre-existing conditions maintain those protections regardless of Obamacare's future."" Romeo was referencing a bill Tillis co-sponsored known as "" The Protect Act ,"" which claims to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But  experts say  that bill falls short. Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow studying health reform and private insurance for the Kaiser Family Foundation, said the bill doesnât prevent insurance companies from price gouging. The bill includes language prohibiting discrimination based on health status. But, Pollitz said, it doesnât prohibit insurers from charging women more than men. She paraphrased lines on pages 9 and 10 of the  bill , saying ""nothing in the nondiscrimination requirement âshall be construed to restrict the amount that an employer or individual may be charged for coverage under a group health plan except as provided in paragraph 3 or individual health coverageâ."" Pollitz said Tillis may have attempted to include price-gouging protections, ""but the language they used is riddled with loopholes that would continue to permit discriminatory rating practices."" To prevent price gouging, health bills should offer subsidies. Tillisâ bill guaranteed the issuance of insurance but didnât provide funding to make premiums affordable, said David Anderson, research associate at Duke Universityâs Center for Health Policy. Under Tillisâ bill, Anderson said there was little incentive to keep healthy people in the market pool. So insurers would have two options. ""They can either leave the market entirely or dramatically increase premiums to cover a very sick and expensive group of people,"" he said. ""Since there are no premium subsidies in this bill, insurance will be too expensive for individuals who are in good health to purchase."" PolitiFact reported  in 2019 that most of the Republican health care plans fail to fully protect people with pre-existing conditions. A fact-check of White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney singled out the plan proposed by Tillis and other Republican senators. It found that the bill included an option for companies to deny certain coverage if they werenât able to ""adequately"" deliver services. That fact-check quote critics of Obamacare, such as health care consultant Bob Laszewski and former Republican Senate health care policy staffer Rodney Whitlock, saying the Republican proposals fall short of the coverage offered by the ACA. Cunninghamâs ad says Tillis voted to take away coverage for pre-existing conditions. Itâs true that Tillis voted for a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act, a move that likely would have left Americans with pre-existing conditions vulnerable. Tillisâ campaign is right to point out that he has tried to address the issue. But experts agree that the Tillis proposal left loopholes insurance companies could use against people with pre-existing conditions. Cunninghamâs statement overlooks some of Tillisâ efforts. But itâs correct about Tillisâ vote and the fact that other Republican plans fall short of matching the ACAâs protections for people with pre-existing conditions. We rate it Mostly True. An earlier version of this fact check quoted an expert who said the ""Protect Act"" introduced by Sen. Tillis would have allowed insurance companies to avoid covering peopleâs pre-existing conditions. In fact, the bill was written to prevent insurance companies from doing that. The expert has revised her comments.Â  This correction has no bearing on the overall rating. Tillis voted to fully repeal the ACA, and bills proposed by Tillis and other Republicans still fall short of matching the ACAâs protections for people with pre-existing conditions.",3/2/20,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/mar/02/cal-cunningham/cunningham-says-tills-voted-take-away-coverage-pre/,1,,Sen.

Sanders has run as an independent in Vermont, was a member of the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007, and has since been a member of the Senate. He calls himself a democratic socialist. There arenât many votes to look at when it comes to Russia, and Sandersâ voting history isnât as clear-cut as the post claims.Â  In recent years, the United States sanctioned Russia in response to allegations of corruption and human rights abuses. It continued sanctions after Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine.Â  Some of the sanctions were imposed by presidential executive order, without any vote in the Senate. Here are the key votes: Dec. 6, 2012:  Sanders  voted no  on the Magnitsky Act, which  imposed  visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the 2009 death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian whistleblower.Â  GQ  reported  on Feb. 23, 2020, that Sanders never explained his vote, but ""fellow Dems suggest that it was because a free trade provision had been tucked into the legislative package."" Sandersâ campaign emphasized to us that in 2015, the Senate with unanimous consent  extended  the law to countries other than Russia, and said it was ""more robust"" than the original law.Â  June 14 and 15, 2017:  Sanders  votes yes  on an amendment to a bill, adding Russia to a bill that was  sanctioning  Iran. But the next day, Sanders voted no on the overall  legislation , which put new sanctions on North Korea, as well as Russia and Iran. On Russia, the bill  targeted  the countryâs aggression in Ukraine and Syria, citing corruption, human rights abuses and weapons sales.Â  Sanders said at the time he feared the bill would endanger the 2015 nuclear deal, which was aimed at curbing Iranâs ability to develop a nuclear weapon. ""I am strongly supportive of the sanctions on Russia included in this bill. It is unacceptable for Russia to interfere in our elections here in the United States, or anywhere around the world. There must be consequences for such actions,"" he said in a  statement  at the time.

Says Mitt Romney voted against convicting President Donald Trump because Burisma board member Joseph Cofer Black âis Romneyâs national security advisorâ and because of ties to Obama CIA director John Brennan.,"Meme spreads dubious theory about why Mitt Romney voted to convict. Joseph Cofer Black was one of many foreign policy advisers to Mitt Romneyâs 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, and he serves on the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company. However, Black is not currently âRomneyâs national security advisor.âÂ   Â  Thereâs no evidence of any close relationship between John Brennan and Romney. In fact, Brennan was working in the Obama administration whenÂ Romney was running against him in the 2012 presidential campaign.  Â  Romney laid out his rationale for voting to convict Trump when he said that Trump abused his power. We see no evidence that his years-old ties to Black are more persuasive in explaining his historic and polarizing vote.","After Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined all Senate Democrats in voting to convict President Donald Trump on an article of impeachment, he became a target of social media ire from Trump allies. One example is a Jan. 31  Facebook post  by the  Committee to Defend the President , a  pro-Trump political action committee  that says on its Facebook page, ""The Crooked Media has shown us time and time again that they can not be trusted, we will defend him!""

He also currently sits on the board of Burisma holdings. JCB joined the CIA in 1974, and was the head of their counter-terrorism center during the 9/11 terror attacks. John Brennan was the CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia who approved the sketchy visas for the 9/11 attackers. He followed JCB as the head of CIAâs counter-terrorism. And this is just scratching the surface of their relationships."" The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our  partnership with Facebook .) We found that the post sprinkles a few facts â and a few erroneous assertions â into an unsupported claim. Weâll take the elements one by one. While Joseph Cofer Black has advised Romney in the past, he is not currently his ""national security advisor,"" Romneyâs office confirmed. Black served as director of the CIAâs Counterterrorism Center from 1999 to 2002 and as U.S. ambassador-at-large for counterterrorism from 2002 to 2004. Since then, heâs worked in the private sector, including a stint as vice chairman of Blackwater, a controversial security contractor.Â  Blackâs relationship with Romney came primarily during Romneyâs two presidential campaigns. Black served as senior adviser for counterterrorism and national security on  Romney's 2008 presidential campaign , then served as a special adviser for national security and foreign policy on  Romneyâs 2012 presidential campaign . The 2012 campaign team assembled dozens of foreign policy experts from the party, as is typical for both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.Â  This appears to be correct, according to the Ukranian energy companyâs  website . When we checked it on Feb. 7, 2020, Black was  listed  as a director of the company. (The companyâs press office did not respond to an inquiry.) In fact, at one point, Black served on the board at the same time as Hunter Biden â the son of former Vice President Joe Biden who became a target of President Donald Trump and whose service on Burismaâs board inspired the actions that led to Trumpâs impeachment. Hereâs an archived version of the companyâs  website  in 2017, showing both Biden and Black. In a  news release  about Blackâs hiring in 2017, Black is quoted saying, ""I was impressed to learn that Burisma Group is the fastest-growing private gas producer in Central Europe. International projects where the Group is involved require a more thorough analysis and risk assessment, not only in terms of conventional risks â financial or political but also in terms of security."" Thatâs correct.Â  As the Daily Beast  noted  in 2012, then-CIA chief George Tenet wrote that after the 9/11 attacks, Black insisted on staying at his office with his staff in a relatively exposed area of the CIA headquarters, rather than moving to a safer location. ""Well, they could die,"" Tenet recalls telling Black about his staff. Black responded, ""Well sir, then they are just going to have to die."" This is false. First, the CIA does not handle visas â the State Department does. The congressionally authorized 9/11 report went into detail about how each of the plot participants secured their visas. ""Individual consular officers (were) involved with the adjudication of visas to the hijackers,""  the report said . Second, during the time that Brennan was  posted  in Saudi Arabia, only a few of the visas were granted to the plotters (and not all of the terrorists got their visas in Saudi Arabia). Shortly after the plot quietly went into motion in 1999, President George W. Bush tapped Brennan to serve as chief of staff to Tenet at CIA headquarters, so Brennan was in the United States for most of the time the attackâs planning was underway. He was named the CIAâs deputy executive director in 2001, serving through 2003. ""He never approved a single U.S. visa,"" said Nick Shapiro, a spokesman for Brennan. This is false, although similar names have tripped up some non-experts. Black was  head  of the CIAâs counter-terrorism center, commonly known as CTC, from 1999 to 2002. The center is a part of the CIA. Brennan, by contrast, was named by Bush as  interim director  of the National Counterterrorism Center, an inter-agency group under the umbrella of the Director of National Intelligence. Brennan served in the post from 2004 to 2005. This is ironic, since during the 2012 presidential campaign, Black was working on behalf of Romney, the Republican challenger, while Brennan was working in the administrationÂ of the incumbent, President Barack Obama. The 2012 Daily Beast article specifically pairs the two as combatants. Black, the article said, was Romneyâs ""trusted man inside the intel community,"" while Brennanâs role for Obama in the administration was ""so powerful that many senior spies complain that Brennan is the de facto CIA chief."" (He would later be named CIA director by Obama.) ""I am not aware of any connection between Gov. Romney and John Brennan, nor can I imagine any, since Brennan was with Obama,"" Andrew Natsios, a professor at Texas A&Mâs Bush School of Government and Public Service, told PolitiFact. Natsios is also a former administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development who served on the same 2012 Romney advisory panel as Black did. That said, times have changed in the Trump era, as Brennan has praised Romney for his stance on impeachment.Â  In October, Brennan  tweeted , ""How many other Republican Senators are ready to show the courage, integrity, & principled position of Senator Romney?Â  Thank you, Senator, for putting our Nation & our Constitution above party politics & the corrupt behavior of Donald Trump."" Foreign policy experts said it is unlikely that Romney was thinking of protecting an adviser from eight years ago when weighing one of the most important votes he would ever cast in the Senate. Romney laid out his reasoning for voting to convict in his widely noted  Senate floor speech .Â  ""Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the presidentâs counsel that a crime had been committed, the presidentâs insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit,"" Romney said. He continued: ""The grave question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the President committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a ""high crime and misdemeanor. Yes, he did."" The Committee to Defend the President did not respond to an inquiry for this article. A Facebook post says that Romney voted against convicting Trump because Burisma board member Joseph Cofer Black ""is Romneyâs national security advisor"" and because of ties to Obama CIA director John Brennan. The meme mixes a few facts with several inaccuracies to make an unsupported assertion. Black was an advisor to Romneyâs 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and according to Burismaâs website, he serves on the companyâs board. However, we see no evidence that Black is still advising Romney eight years later, and the notion that Brennan is close to Romney is undermined by the fact that he was working for the Obama administration when Romney was trying to unseat Obama in the 2012 presidential race. All told, Romneyâs public explanation about why he voted to convict in such an important case is clear and more plausible than a desire to protect an adviser from eight years ago. We rate the statement False.

Bernie Sanders isnât a big fan of President Donald Trumpâs latest defense spending bill. Tuesday morning, the U.S. Senate voted 86-8 in favor of the $738 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2020, sending it to the president for his signature.Â  The day before senators passed the legislation, Sanders published  an op-ed in the Washington Post  panning the proposal, writing he opposes the bill as he as ""all previous Trump military budgets."" Hours after the Tuesday vote, the Vermont senator and Democratic candidate for president doubled down, posting  a video to his campaignâs social media  accounts, in which Sanders explained how cutting defense spending could pay for his proposed social programs. Sanders begins his video with a claim about his voting record on Trumpâs defense spending proposals. ""I am very proud that I am the only candidate in the Democratic primary to have voted against all of Trump's defense budgets,"" Sanders  says in the campaign video . But Sanders, like many other candidates who also serve in the Senate, missed this weekâs vote. So how can he claim to have voted against it? And is he actually the only anti-Trump presidential candidate in the Democratic field who has voted against all of the presidentâs defense budgets? Sandersâ presidential campaign declined to comment on the statement, referring questions to Sandersâ Senate office. Keane Bhatt, Sandersâ Senate spokesperson, pointed to the Vermont independentâs votes against the defense budget bill for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017.Â  Bhatt deferred back to the campaign on the first part of Sandersâ claim that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to vote against all of Trumpâs military spending bills. The campaign did not respond with evidence to support this part of the statement.Â Â Â  Sanders has voted against the last three national defense authorization bills but he was not present in the Senate for Tuesdayâs vote on the bill he has publicly opposed. Sandersâ Senate office also said his vote against the defense spending bill fiscal year 2017 was evidence he has voted against all of Trumpâs military budget bills. However, the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2017  was signed by former President Barack Obama  on Dec. 23, 2016, and not by Trump. A survey of Sandersâ record on Trumpâs defense spending bills has him voting against the first two but  missing the vote earlier this week . The Vermont independent  also missed the chance to vote  on this yearâs military spending bill in June when the Senate moved it to the House of Representatives. Sanders also claims he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against all of the presidentâs defense budgets. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., all missed this weekâs vote on the military spending bill. Warren voted against last yearâs defense budget, but supported Trumpâs first national defense authorization proposal. Booker and Klobuchar have supported both of Trumpâs previous military budget bills. However, there is one other candidate in the crowded Democratic field who has cast votes in opposition of all three of the presidentâs defense authorization bills. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii â who is  polling between 1% and 3% nationally  and has remained in the race as others have started dropping out â was one of 48 House members  to vote against  the current $738 billion spending proposal. Gabbard has also cast no votes on the legislation in  2018  and  2017  â Trumpâs two other military budgets.Â  The House member from Hawaii also voted against President Obamaâs last defense spending budget in  2016 . In a campaign video that has been viewed almostÂ 320,000 times on Twitter alone, Sanders made the statement that he has voted against all of Trumpâs defense budgets and that he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary to do so. It is true the Vermont senator has publicly opposed all of the presidentâs military spending packages, but he has not voted against all of them. Sanders is also wrong to say he is the only candidate in the Democratic primary who has voted against the proposals. In fact, Gabbard is the only candidate who can make that claim.Â  We rate this statement as False.",12/20/19,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-wrong-twice-claim-about-defense-bud/,1,,Bernie Sander voted against all of Trump's defense budgets
"Says Thom Tillis voted to support Trumpâs emergency declaration to fund the border wall even though it would ""raid $80 million from North Carolina.""",Did Thom Tillis vote to let Trump administration raid $80 million from NC military projects?,"Democrats say President Trumpâs border wall has raided North Carolina of $80 million for military projects with the support of the stateâs Republican senator Thom Tillis.Â  Trump decided the money was needed because, contrary to his stump speech rallying cry, Mexico wonât foot the bill for the wall. Instead, the funds will come from military construction projects across the United States and abroad.Â  Trump gained access to those funds after declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Congress has voted twice â first in March and then in late September â to block the emergency declaration. But both times, Democrats were unable to secure a two-thirds majority and Trump vetoed the measures. After the most recent vote, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee called out Tillis, who voted against blocking the presidentâs emergency declaration. The DSCCâs tweet said, ""Thom Tillis yet again voted to support Trumpâs irresponsible emergency declaration â even though he knows it will allow the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina. Tillisâ vote is putting military communities in harmâs way."" We wondered if itâs true that Tillis supported the emergency declaration and whether North Carolina actually stands to lose $80 million. Trump used the National Emergencies Act to secure border wall fundingÂ  During the 2016 campaign, President Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border and have Mexico pay for it. When Congress reached a stalemate over funding border security, Trump decided to act on his own. He declared a national emergency at the southern border, an initial step toward building the wall.Â  He acted under the  National Emergencies Act , which authorizes the administration to ""undertake military construction projects â¦ not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces."" The move angered some members of Congress who believed that Trump was abusing the National Emergencies Act. Tillis even wrote an  op-ed  for The Washington Post that said the emergency declaration ""was not the right answer.""Â  But when Congress voted to overturn the emergency declaration in March, Tillis sided with Trump. He voted to uphold the presidentâs action  both   times . (The reversal earned Tillis a  Full Flop  on PolitiFactâs Flip-O-Meter.) On the  Senate floor , he explained that he did not take issue with Trumpâs action, but instead was concerned that the National Emergencies Act gives future presidents too much power. ""My main concern with this executive action is future potential abuses. I have a concern with the executive action that the president took, the emergency order. Thatâs why I voiced it,"" Tillis said. ""But Iâm sympathetic to what he was trying to do â¦ and I thought we could view this as an opportunity to where maybe we could have a discussion about the National Emergencies Act and potentially make a real difference here."" Tillis is a co-sponsor of the Article One Act, which was introduced days before the March vote and would automatically end emergency declarations after 30 days. The measure has stalled in the Senate since then. But in the meantime, Tillis is supporting Trumpâs decision to divert funding from military bases around the world. The National Emergencies Act requires the money for the wall come from other military construction projects that have been appropriated, but not obligated, by Congress. That means the administration has to take money from dozens of projects, such as a fire and crash rescue station at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, a dining facility at Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, and a small arms range at Truax Field in Wisconsin. NC to lose $80 million The Pentagon  listed  each project affected by the national emergency at the southern border. It includes four at North Carolina military bases, and they do in fact total $80 million as the DSCC claims.Â  The North Carolina projects are a new battalion complex and ambulatory care center at Camp Lejeune, an elementary school at Fort Bragg, and a tanker storage facility at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. None of the projects were scheduled to break ground until 2020. But while the DSCCâs statement is accurate, thereâs an important caveat. Almost $33 million of the $80 million would have been reallocated anyway because the $32.9 million Fort Bragg school project had already been canceled ""due to declining enrollment."" The construction of the school would have been canceled regardless of Trumpâs emergency declaration and its funding could have been reallocated to other projects in North Carolina or elsewhere. (Fort Bragg has  several urgent needs , including a $21 million fire station.) In a September  town hall , Tillis acknowledged the $80 million shift in funding but said, ""Half of that was for a project at Fort Bragg that was not moving forward."" Funding for the other three projects remains uncertain, but Tillis has given assurances that Congress can replenish the money. In an  op-ed  in the Greensboro News & Record, Tillis wrote that Congress ""has plenty of time to re-allocate funding"" and called on other members of Congress to vote for the National Defense Authorization Act. Our ruling The DSCC said Tillis supported Trumpâs emergency declaration, which enabled the administration to raid $80 million from North Carolina military projects. The group is correct that the Trump administration diverted $80 million that had been appropriated by Congress for four military projects in North Carolina. But that included an elementary school at Fort Bragg that had already been canceled.Â  The claim is accurate but needs additional information.

Phil Scott ""just voted"" to impeach President Donald Trump, as a Facebook post claims. ""Hi Iâm Vermont Republican Phil Scott.

The post was flagged as part of Facebookâs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about  our partnership with Facebook .) The Facebook post is wrong on several accounts: a governor has no voting role in impeachment proceedings, there hasnât been a vote to impeach Trump, and the governor didnât even say Trump should be impeached. What has Scott said or done? Below is the background provided by Rebecca Kelley, the governorâs communications director. On Sept. 25, Scottâs office received an inquiry from the Associated Press asking for comment regarding the impeachment inquiry against Trump formally announced Sept. 24 by U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. Scottâs office sent the Associated Press a statement which in part said, ""we have much more to learn and need to understand all the facts as this serious allegation is considered. It appears Congress will be starting an inquiry process, which I believe is appropriate."" Impeachment shouldnât be taken lightly or abused, Scottâs statement said, adding that he hoped Congress would be objective and transparent in their process. On Sept. 26, the governor at his pre-scheduled weekly press conference again was asked about the impeachment inquiry. VTDigger.org  reported  that Scott said he supported the inquiry, but hoped it would be driven by facts, not politics. ""I think this is Congressâ responsibility and, again, let the facts determine the course of action moving forward,"" Scott said, according to VTDigger.orgâs reporting. ""When we see the facts, when I see the facts, Iâd be happy to comment on that when it happens. I donât want to get ahead of this."" Kelley emphasized to PolitiFact that Scottâs comments have been on the inquiry process and that heâs said that the outcome should not be predetermined, but fact-based. So the Facebook post takes a step ahead of what Scott has said about the inquiry process to inaccurately claim that he ""just voted"" to impeach Trump. The Facebook post additionally ignores the facts that impeachment-related votes involve the U.S. Congress, not state governors. The House also has yet to cast a vote on impeachment. ( Read our story  on how the impeachment process works.) Our ruling A Facebook post says Scott ""just voted to impeach President Trump."" Scott has not done that. As Vermontâs governor, Scott cannot vote on this issue. Impeachment proceedings are a matter of Congress, not state governors.

"""I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment.""",Bernie Sanders oversimplifies record on Hyde Amendment.,"The Hyde Amendment is statutory language that bars federal dollars from being used to pay for most abortions. Though decades old, it suddenly became a point of controversy in the 2020 presidential campaign, as rivals of Joe Biden criticized his history of voting for it. The  Hyde Amendment  was named for its original champion, the late Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and has been passed by Congress regularly since 1977. It says the federal government canât pay for abortions, but it has always included an exception for the life of the mother, and most of the time it has included exceptions for rape and incest as well. Opponents of abortion rights have made maintaining the Hyde Amendment a longstanding priority. Now, those who favor abortion rights are prioritizing its repeal. The  criticism from rivals  in June 2019 drove Biden to change his position. On June 6, Biden announced that â like the rest of the Democratic presidential field â he  now opposes the policy . One of Bidenâs presidential primary opponents, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took to Twitter to tout his position against the Hyde Amendment. Sanders  tweeted  on June 6: ""If we believe that a woman has the constitutional right to control her own body, that right must apply to ALL women, including low-income women. That is why I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment and why, as president, I would eliminate it."" If we believe that a woman has the constitutional right to control her own body, that right must apply to ALL women, including low-income women. That is why I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment and why, as president, I would eliminate it. A reader wrote us to suggest we check into Sandersâ assertion that ""I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment."" When we looked, we found that the story is more complicated than Sanders indicated. The Hyde Amendment is usually inserted into the yearly bills that fund the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result, Biden (who served as a Democratic senator from Delaware between 1973 and 2009) and other members of Congress were confronted with legislation containing the amendment on many occasions. The key factor that Sandersâ tweet obscures is that the Hyde Amendment usually isnât voted on as a standalone bill. More often, itâs included in massive appropriations bills. In some cases, voting no on these big spending bills risks a government shutdown. In general, Sanders has indeed voted the pro-abortion-rights way on bills and amendments specific to the Hyde Amendment. But heâs often voted for the final spending measures that included the Hyde language. ""Large bills always contain lots of items a particular lawmaker might not like, but they are usually unwilling to sink the entire bill to prevent the enactment of one provision,"" said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University who studies congressional procedure. A good illustration can be seen in a pair of votes Sanders took in 1993, when he was serving in the House. In  one case that year , the House voted  255-178  to specifically keep the Hyde Amendment in the relevant spending bill. Sanders voted no, at a time when a large number of Democrats â 98 â were joining most Republicans in voting to keep the amendment on the books. Despite this, Sanders voted on behalf of the final version of the spending bill. The measure passed by a  305-124  margin, with 237 Democrats supporting it. Sandersâ campaign cited several occasions in which he has voted with the abortion-rights side on a specific Hyde Amendment bill â in the 1993 example cited above, plus additional measures in  1997 ,  2001 ,  2009 , and  2019 . When we reviewed appropriations votes going back to 1999, however, we found numerous occasions in which Sanders backed the final version of a spending bill that funded the Department of Health and Human Services, all of which included language enacting the Hyde Amendment. As a senator, Sanders voted for such bills for fiscal years  2016 ,  2014 ,  2013 ,  2010 ,  2008 ,  2007 , and 2006, when the bill passed by unanimous consent by all senators. As a House member, he voted for such bills for fiscal years  2005 ,  2002 ,  2001 , and  1999 . ""Democrats tend to support"" spending bills for HHS, said University of Miami political scientist Gregory Koger, another congressional specialist. ""For a Democrat who supports social welfare but is also pro-choice, I think they have made peace with some version of Hyde language and just try to resist encroachment."" Sandersâ voting discrepancy caught the eye of CNN host Dana Bash. When she interviewed Sanders on CNN's "" State of the Union "" on June 9, she asked Sanders, ""You said this week that you have âalways voted against the Hyde Amendment.â But you have actually voted in the past to support large spending bills that include the Hyde Amendment. Is it misleading, Senator, to say that you have never voted for it?"" Sanders responded by saying that sometimes ""in a large bill, you have to vote for things you don't like. But I think my record as being literally 100 percent pro-choice is absolutely correct. Look, if you believe, as I do, that a woman's right to control her own body is a constitutional right, then that must apply to all women, including low-income women. That is what I have always believed, and that is what I believe right now."" Sandersâ campaign told PolitiFact that the senator has consistently received strong voting scores from abortion rights groups. These scores generally factor in votes taken on measures specific to the Hyde Amendment, but not the broader spending bills that happen to include the Hyde language. Sanders has  frequently been given  a 100 percent rating from both NARAL Pro-Choice America and a zero from the National Right to Life Committee. Sanders tweeted, ""I have consistently voted against the Hyde Amendment."" Sandersâ comments suggest a purity on the issue that isnât possible for senators who want to vote in favor of major spending bills to fund the government. He has a point that when the Hyde Amendment has come up as a stand-alone measure, he has voted with the pro-abortion-rights side. However, Sanders left out that he has voted numerous times for broad spending bills that included a version of the Hyde Amendment. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",6/11/19,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/11/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-oversimplifies-record-hyde-amendmen/,1,,Bernie Sanders voted against Hyde Amendment
"Says he ""cast the deciding vote"" to override a vetoed âborn aliveâ bill",NC Republican claims credit for 'born alive' veto override.,"Gov. Roy Cooper recentlyÂ  vetoed Â a bill that would place new penalties on any medical professional who willingly allows infants to die if they survived an abortion. Cooper and most Democrats said the legislation brings needless government rules into complicated medical situations. Republicans, though, say the rules are necessary. And on April 30, the state Senate voted to override Cooperâs veto. Afterward, legislator Dan Bishop, whoâs running for Congress in North Carolinaâs 9th Congressional District, took credit for advancing the override. ""I was proud to cast the deciding vote tonight in the State Senate to end infanticide in North Carolina, over liberalÂ  Governor Roy Cooper âs veto,"" Bishop posted on his Facebook page andÂ  website . First, Bishopâs claim that he voted to ""end infanticide"" in North Carolina is misleading because current federal laws already protect newborns born alive through the course of an abortion, asÂ  PolitiFact reported Â last month. Since weâve already written about that, letâs look instead at Bishopâs claim that he was the ""deciding vote."" We believe this statement warranted attention because it suggests Bishop was a swing vote and that the billâs fate depended on Bishop and Bishop alone. This is aÂ  type of claim Â that PolitiFact has been reviewingÂ  for years . Itâs common for politicians to try to take sole credit for a lawâs success or, conversely, for their opponents to try to assign someone sole blame. But often those claims are exaggerated, and thatâs the case with Bishop too. Thirty votes were needed for the override and Bishop provided one of the predicted Republican votes. But the GOP-authored bill wouldnât have advanced without the help of a Democrat. 1 OF 30 NEEDED VOTES To override a veto, the state House and state Senate each need three-fifths of their present members to support the idea. On April 30, the Senateâs override vote wasÂ  30 in favor and 20 opposed Â â meaning the effort advanced by one vote. While Bishopâs vote mathematically was important, itâs misleading for him to say he cast the ""deciding"" vote. Gerry Cohen, former special counsel to the N.C. General Assembly and longtime legislative staffer, described Bishopâs claim as a ""non sequitur."" ""I suppose with an oral roll call vote you could definitively say who the 30th yes vote was,"" Cohen said. ""Otherwise itâs puffery (though) not incorrect from a technical sense."" In North Carolina, key votes are typically conducted electronically at the same time. Itâs not like an elementary school classroom where a teacher calls out each studentâs name, one by one. So thereâs rarely the kind of drama that the late U.S. Sen.Â  John McCainÂ  generated in 2018, when he walked to the center of the Senate floor and made a thumbs-down motion to vote against a ""skinny repeal"" of the Affordable Care Act. HOW IT WORKS North Carolinaâs voting procedure is more like a silent auction, or the final round of the television show ""Jeopardy!"" The chamber is silent, and senators are given time to press a button. Votes are anonymous until the results are displayed on a screen. And the screen doesnât show results until each vote is cast. The system is structured in a way that it rarely places pressure on any one legislator. However, lawmakers sometimes bring the spotlight upon themselves by voting out-of-lockstep with their party, by trying to change their vote, or both. In 2012, for instance, fracking was legalized in North Carolina after a Democrat from Charlotte accidentally pushed the wrong button and voted with Republicans. Rep. Becky Carney made the mistake late at night. Just after the vote, her voice could be heard on her microphone, saying ""Oh my gosh. I pushed green,""Â  WRAL reported . She asked Thom Tillis, whoâs now a U.S. Senator but at the time was NC House Speaker, if she could change her vote. Changing votes is sometimes allowed, but Tillis said no. In the vote Bishop referenced, Sen. Don Davis of Pitt County received the most attention. He was theÂ  only Democrat who voted with Republicans Â to support the override, giving the GOP the one vote it needed to advance the override effort. As of May 8, Cooperâs veto still stands because the House hasnât taken an override vote. OUR RULING Bishop said he ""cast the deciding vote"" to override a vetoed ""born-alive"" bill. His vote was important because, without it, the override effort would fail. But it would have also failed without any of the other 29 votes. So itâs misleading for Bishop to say he cast the ""deciding"" vote. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Hanger has been the district's state senator since 1996Â and served in the House of Delegates from 1983 to 1992. Freitas is opposing Hanger from the right on social and financial issues. ""I believe in your right to make to make (your) life everything it can possibly be through your hard work and ingenuity through the free market and voluntary cooperation,"" she said during an April 8  interview  on Virginia Free Radio. ""On the other hand, you have my opponent who has voted for the three largest tax increases - proposed tax increases - in Virginia history,"" she added. We fact checked whether Hanger has, indeed, backed the three biggest proposed tax hikes in state history. Freitasâ list Freitas - the wife of Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper - sent us a list of the votes at the heart of her claim. They are: 1:  A failed  $1 billion  annual tax increase proposed in 2006 by Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine to improve transportation. It would have raised levies on gas and motor vehicle sales. Hanger voted for the bill, telling us he thought it was fair and would help his rural constituents. The bill easily passed the Senate with bipartisan support, but died in a House committee. 2:  A  transportation tax package passed in 2013  that reaped $1.25 billion last year when it was fully phased in. The plan was proposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, and passed with bipartisan support. Its key elements were raising state levies on gas and general sales, and creating authorities in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads that have imposed regional taxes for roads. Hanger opposed the bill each of three times it faced an up-or-down Senate vote, telling us he thought the plan was ""convoluted,"" and not of ample help to rural areas. Freitas, in claiming Hanger supported the tax hikes, cites a procedural vote. The House and the Senate passed different versions of the bill and Hanger voted to allow the chambers to work out a compromise - a traditional courtesy in the General Assembly. When the compromise was reached, Hanger voted against it. 3: Â  A successful  $700 million tax increase  in 2004 proposed by Democratic Gov. Mark Warner to help education and other general services. The key component was a half-penny sales tax hike. Hanger voted for the package, which had bipartisan support. Half-century list Freitasâ stated that Hanger voted for the three largest ""proposed tax increases in Virginia history."" But the list she sent us doesnât meet that criteria. We canât go back to Virginiaâs first legislature in 1619 and review every tax increase thatâs been proposed, but weâre confident $100 million-plus packages are fairly modern developments. We reviewed major tax-increase proposals since the 1960s and adjusted them for  inflation in 2019 dollars . Hereâs list of the three highest proposals and Hangerâs role in them: 1:  A  failed $2.3 billion tax increase  for education and transportation was proposed in 2004 by Sen. John Chichester, R-Stafford, who was chairman of the Finance Committee. The package would have significantly raised taxes on sales, income and fuel, among other things. Adjusted for inflation, the plan would have raised about $3.2 billion this year. The bill gave cover to Warnerâs effort that year (discussed above) to win a more modest $700 million hike for education. Hanger voted for Chichesterâs more expensive plan, telling us that the state had needs in transportation and education, and it was a good idea to raise taxes for both at the same time. The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support and was killed in a House committee. 2:  Landmark legislation in 1966 by Democratic Gov. Mills Godwin that established the state sales tax - phased in at 3% over three years with an additional 1% option for localities. The tax, earmarked for public education and to help build the community college system, brought in $282 million for the budget year ending June 30, 1970, according to a report from the Department of Taxation. Thatâs equal to $1.9 billion this year. Hanger wasnât in the legislature in 1966 and had no vote on the bill.Â  3:  McDonnellâs 2013 tax increase for transportation, worth $1.25 billion this year. Hanger, as we noted, voted against the measure. All told, we checked Hangerâs record on six major tax increase proposals over the last half century. He voted for three of the bills, opposed two, and wasnât in office when one was was considered. Hanger stands by all his votes. ""Fiscal responsibility requires paying your bills,"" he said. Our ruling Freitas says Hanger ""has voted for the three largest tax increases - proposed tax increases - in Virginia history."" Her list of the largest proposals is flawed and, in one instance, misrepresents Hangerâs up-or-down votes. Hangerâs record on taxes is nuanced; sometimes backing increases, sometimes opposing them. Of the three largest tax-hike proposals since 1966, Hanger voted for one, against one, and wasnât in office when one was considered. So we rate Freitasâ claim Mostly False.

"Says Joe Biden ""voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation.""",Progressive Democratic group's attack on Joe Biden's voting record needs some context.,"As soon as former Vice President Joe Biden announced his run for the presidency, he drew fire from the more progressive side of the Democratic Party. Justice Democrats, a group that backs Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and other new faces in Congress, issued a tweet thread laying out why Biden is not their candidate. ""Joe Biden stands in near complete opposition to where the center of energy is in the Democratic Party today,"" the group  wrote April 25 . ""We donât need someone who voted for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and for the Bankruptcy Reform Act, while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation."" The six issues in that tweet have long been seen as Bidenâs Achillesâ heel in this Democratic primary. Bidenâs votes are a matter of record, but on some points, such as gay marriage, Biden switched his position. This is accurate.Â A little after midnight on Oct. 11, 2002, Biden joined 28 Democrats and 48 Republicans in the U.S. Senate to  authorize the use of military force against Iraq . While the resolution encouraged working through the U.N. Security Council to disarm Iraq, it gave President George W. Bush a free hand to use American armed forces ""as he determines to be necessary and appropriate."" The night of the vote,  Biden said his concerns were eased by Bush  who had said ""war is neither imminent nor inevitable."" Formally, the authorization was not a vote for war, but there was little doubt at the time that war would come. He voted for bills that had that effect. Biden voted for two large bills in 1988 and 1994 that experts agree added millions of people to Americaâs prisons. But both were sprawling pieces of legislation that included programs to reduce incarceration, too. The  Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988  funded alcohol and drug treatment programs and efforts to reach high-risk youth. On the other hand, it doubled down on imposing stiffer penalties for possession of crack cocaine, more common in African American communities, than for possession of powdered cocaine, more common among whites. And it extended mandatory minimum sentences to people under 21 who sold less than 5 grams of marijuana. Biden was one of 87 senators to approve the bill. He also voted for the  Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , along with 53 other Democrats.Â Among other features, the bill included the Violence Against Women Act and banned 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons. It funded 100,000 new police officers to expand community policing. But it also imposed life sentences on many more people through a federal ""three strikes and youâre out"" provision, and it provided over $12 billion to help states build prisons. To get the money, states had to pass laws to keep people behind bars for at least 85% of their sentences. With more people serving longer sentences, the prison population skyrocketed, doubling between  2004 and 2009 . He did. In the early 2000s, Biden co-sponsored legislation that would make it harder for people to qualify for bankruptcy protection. The financial industry, a major donor to Bidenâs campaigns, was eager to tighten the rules on Chapter 7, the most common path for households to wipe out their debts. In 2005, Biden backed the  Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , and on a vote of 74 to 25, it passed the Senate and became law. Under it, if a person made more than the median income in their state, and could afford to pay $100 a month on their debts, then they could not file for Chapter 7 protection. He did, but he later changed his position. Justice Democrats told us this charge against Biden tracks back to his 1996 vote on the  Defense of Marriage Act . The measure defined marriage as between a man and a woman and allowed states not to recognize same-sex marriages. Same-sex couples could not claim federal benefits. Biden was one of 85 senators to vote in favor . By 2012, then-Vice President Biden had changed his views. In an interview on  NBCâs Meet the Press , Biden said, ""I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and heterosexual men and women marrying one other are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties."" At the time, that went beyond where the Obama administration stood, which  triggered some quick press work  by the White House communications team. Most of his votes favored abortion rights, with limits. As a Catholic, Biden has always navigated between the doctrines of his church and the policies of his party on abortion. The tension came to a head in March 1982 when Biden voted in committee to approve a constitutional amendment that allowed states to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court case that affirmed abortion rights. The amendment never came to a full Senate vote. And the next year, on a second try, Biden voted against it. Biden settled on a position in which he separated his personal beliefs from government policy. In the  2012 vice presidential debate , he said he believes that life begins at conception, as the Catholic church says. But he rejected the idea that government could impose that belief on everyone. ""I do not believe that we have a right to tell other people that women can't control their body,"" Biden said. ""It's a decision between them and their doctor."" Biden added that the government should not help pay for women to have an abortion. He voted against busing, but he supported desegregation. Biden won his Senate seat in 1972 on a platform of integration, but once in office, he came under strong pressure from white constituents who hated the idea of busing to desegregate schools. Historian Jason Sokol at the University of New Hampshire tracked Bidenâs response to local opposition. In the Senate, Biden began voting for anti-busing amendments. In 1974, he said ""I have become convinced that busing is a bankrupt concept."" ""Biden always claimed that he favored school desegregation but opposed busing as the means to achieve it,"" Sokol told us. ""The amendments that he proposed, or supported, in the mid and late 1970s, paint a somewhat muddled picture. He did indeed propose some amendments that would have effectively hamstrung all efforts for desegregation. When he was made aware of those practical effects, he sometimes backed off â and he sometimes pressed on nonetheless."" We reached out to Bidenâs campaign and did not hear back. Bidenâs spokesman Bill Russo  told CNN  recently that Biden continues to believe that busing could not deliver a true solution to unequal education opportunity. ""Joe Biden is today â and has been for more than 40 years in public life â one of the strongest and most powerful voices for civil rights in America,"" Russo told CNN. Justice Democrats accused Biden on six points: Voting for the Iraq War, for mass incarceration, and the Bankruptcy Reform Act, ""while voting against gay marriage, reproductive rights, and school desegregation."" On each, there is a measure of accuracy. Bidenâs support for the bankruptcy law has the clearest proof, and the Iraq resolution is a close second. For the others, there are varying degrees of nuance. The crime bills greatly expanded the prison population, but they included other measures that aimed to protect women and offered alternatives to incarceration. Bidenâs views on gay marriage changed. He once supported giving states the option to overturn Roe vs. Wade, but then opposed such a move, and his views on abortion affirm a basic right, while allowing for limits. He opposed busing, but favored integration by other means. The Biden record is more mixed than this claim would suggest.

"""I was the only member of the Senate â Republican or Democrat â who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ânuclear optionâ to change the rules of the Senate.""",Is Joe Manchin the only senator to consistently vote against the nuclear option?,"For decades, majority leaders in the U.S. Senate have threatened to use the ""nuclear option"" to change senatorsâ ability to filibuster, a maneuver that blocks bills from coming to a vote unless a supermajority of the chamber votes to proceed. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is one member of the body who has fought to protect the status quo. In a recent  tweet , Manchin said, ""I was the only member of the Senate â Republican or Democrat â who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ânuclear optionâ to change the rules of the Senate. This move is a betrayal of the people we represent."" #ICYMI : I was the only member of the Senate â Republican or Democrat â who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ânuclear optionâ to change the rules of the Senate. This move is a betrayal of the people we represent. MORE:  https://t.co/qLLf42TaFG We wondered whether Manchin was right that he had a uniquely consistent record on such votes. So we reached out to two experts in Senate procedure to see whether Manchinâs statement was accurate. (Manchinâs office did not respond to an inquiry.) First, some background on the nuclear option. As weâve previously  noted , there is a  legend of uncertain veracity  that says George Washington and Thomas Jefferson came to agree that the Senate should serve as a ""saucer"" to the Houseâs ""tea cup"" â a vessel for cooling the passions emanating from the House. Whether the specifics of the tale hold up, the idea that the Senate is the slower, more cautious half of Congress has been the chamberâs reputation throughout its history. The Constitution delegates internal rule-setting to the Senate itself, and for much of its history, the chamber â unlike the House â did not implement any mechanism to maneuver around a member who was determined enough to block action through a filibuster. In 1917, the Senate voted to empower a supermajority of two-thirds to cut off a filibuster and move on to other business by invoking a motion known as ""cloture."" (Since the Senate had 96 members then, that meant 64 were needed to invoke cloture if all members were voting.) Then, in 1975, the Senate voted to lower the supermajority to its current number, 60 out of 100 members. Still, 60 votes is a significant hurdle for a chamber that has not often had one party win that many seats. In recent years, the two parties have become more polarized, and more willing to filibuster, even on matters that had previously been treated as routine. That has put pressure on Senate leaders to get rid of the longstanding supermajority hurdle or else face gridlock -- especially for such high-stakes topics as nominations. Detractors have warned that such important matters were better dealt with using the higher degree of consensus conveyed through a 60-vote supermajority. But there is one tool available to a Senate leader willing to buck the chamberâs long standing tradition: the nuclear option. The mechanics of the nuclear option (which has nothing to do with anything literally nuclear) are complex even by the standards of parliamentary maneuvers, requiring a precise series of carefully choreographed steps. Readers brave enough to tackle the details can refer to multi-page explanations in these  two   reports  by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The gist, though, is that the majority party would move to change the supermajority rule through a series of votes that require only a simple majority. Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, cited four key votes for the nuclear option. One came in 2013, when the Democrats were in control, one came in 2017, when Republicans were in control, and the final one came in 2019, when the Republicans were still in control. In  2013 , the Democratic leadership used the nuclear option to get rid of the filibuster for all nominations except Supreme Court appointments. Manchin voted against his own party, to keep the status quo. In  2017 , Republicans leaders called a vote to eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations. Here, Manchin cast a vote to maintain the status quo, siding with Democrats against the Republican majority seeking to go nuclear. Then, in 2019, Republican leaders offered two relevant votes. While they werenât specifically about filibusters, they addressed delaying tactics that can advantage the minority. One vote  would shorten  the debate time after cloture from 30 hours to 2 hours for district judges. The second  would do the same  for non-Cabinet executive appointments. In both cases, Manchin voted to maintain the status quo. In 2013, two fellow Democratic senators voted with Manchin and against their partyâs leadership -- then-Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. Neither remains in the chamber. And two Republicans who voted with Democrats in the 2019 votes had stuck with their own party in the 2017 vote, meaning that their voting record wasnât ""consistent"" with the status quo in all cases. Manchin said, ""I was the only member of the Senate â Republican or Democrat â who has consistently voted against efforts to use the so called ânuclear optionâ to change the rules of the Senate."" Experts in Senate procedure tell PolitiFact that Manchin is correct, having voted in favor of the status quo -- and against ""nuclear option"" efforts -- in each of the four relevant votes between 2013 and 2019. We rate this statement True.",4/24/19,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/24/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-only-senator-consistently-vote-against/,1,,Joe Manchin voted against efforts to use the so called nuclear option to change the rule of the Senate
"""In Springfield, Susana Mendoza voted to hit working families with a massive new soda tax.""",Chicoâs soda tax swipe at Mendoza falls flat.,"Negative ads are a staple of politics, but a  new one  from Chicago mayoral candidate Gery Chico slaps at not just one of his rivals but three. ""In Springfield, Susana Mendoza voted to hit working families with a massive new soda tax,"" a narrator says. ""Two years later, Mendoza voted for billions in new income taxes on the middle class, but she voted to raise her own pay twice. Toni Preckwinkleâs soda taxes, sales and new parking taxes will force more families out. And Bill Daleyâs commuter tax is a job killer."" Thatâs a lot packed into just 30 seconds, and in the spirit of succinctness we can say Chico is playing fast and loose with his scattershot accusations. The attack on Preckwinkle is a prediction for the future based in part on a tax that has been repealed. As for Daleyâs so-called commuter tax, weâve already rated  Mostly False  a similar claim from Mendoza. And, for the record, Daley has never endorsed such an idea. That brings us to the soda tax charge levelled against Mendoza, who is currently the state comptroller but once was a member of the Illinois House. It intrigued us because we had never heard of a soda tax being proposed at the state level. First, some context for the term ""soda tax,"" a phrase likely to elicit strong reactions from Chicago area voters in the wake of Cook Countyâs short-lived and much-maligned tax on sweetened beverages. Thatâs the soda tax Chico refers to in his ad while blasting Preckwinkle, who  helped the county board pass it   and became a prominent defender. The penny-an-ounce charge infuriated pop lovers when they discovered even previously  free fountain drink refills  were subject to the tax. Just  two months  after it took effect in late 2017, county commissioners repealed the tax. So Chico is seizing on a potent symbol in his attack on Mendoza. A  campaign press release  announcing the adâs debut goes even further, referring to Mendoza as the ""Original Soda Taxer"" and accusing her of ""two-faced political hypocrisy"" for having criticized the soda tax Preckwinkle pushed. When we followed the citation in Chicoâs ad to the Illinois General Assemblyâs website, however, we didnât find anything resembling Cook Countyâs soda tax. State records show the bill Mendoza voted for, in 2009, was a sweeping  measure  that both legalized video gambling in Illinois and funded a  $31 billion capital spending program . Chico has, by the way,  indicated he supports  video gambling as a potential revenue source for Chicago to tap. To pay for borrowing costs to bankroll construction projects, the bill hiked taxes on alcoholic beverages, increased fines and fees for drivers, and imposed higher sales taxes on products like candy bars and soft drinks that previously had been taxed like groceries at a steep discount. It passed in the House with  a bipartisan, veto-proof majority . Records of the  floor debate  show several lawmakers raised concerns about the bill, but none focused on the impact on soda sales. Prior to the 2009 bill Mendoza supported, which later was signed into law, about 2-cents in state sales tax would have been added to the purchase of a two-liter bottle of soda costing $2.29. The law hiked the tax to 12-cents for the same purchase, whereas the short-lived Cook County soda tax added about 67-cents. Chico said that as a state lawmaker, ""Susana Mendoza voted to hit working families with a massive new soda tax."" The claim follows a well-worn partisan script in which a candidate blows out of proportion a minor piece of legislation an opponent once supported. Mendoza indeed voted for a bill that imposed a modest increase in the cost of not just soda purchases but also candy, booze and other items. Had she voted against that bill, which passed with strong support from all corners, she also would have been turning thumbs down on major infrastructure spending, expanded gambling and more. Whatâs more, changing the tax rate for a handful of items is a far cry from creating a new tax specific to sweetened beverages. The change also costs consumers considerably less at the register than did the now-defunct Cook County soda tax Chico has compared it to. We rate his claim Mostly False.

"Says New York Rep.Â John Faso ""cast the deciding vote"" to try to kill health care protections provided by Obamacare.",Who's to blame for almost killing Obamacare? Democrats point to New York's John Faso.,"In 2017, as Republicans considered measures to repeal and replace Obamacare, the House Budget Committee took an important preliminary vote. It decided 19 to 17 to advance the American Health Care Act. That means, the Democratic Party says, that Rep. John Faso of New York Â ""cast the deciding vote to deny protections for pre-existing conditions."" The claim is in a  new ad  the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put on the air in the closing days of the race in New York Congressional District 19 south of Albany, where Faso faces a challenge from Antonio Delgado. Faso, the DCCC says, could have stopped the whole bill, one that critics say could have been deeply harmful to people who need the protections the Affordable Care Act provides. It only failed later because the Senate lacked the support for its version. Was Faso the deciding vote? Letâs look at the math. The committee vote on March 16, 2017, was  19-17 . That means it passed by two votes. But if just one lawmaker who voted yes had voted no instead, the count would have been 18-18, a tie. ""It fails if it is a tie,"" DCCC spokesman Evan Lukaske told us. And that could have stopped everything that followed, he said. Couldnât any of the others have done the same thing? How can you say one member was the deciding vote? The DCCC allows that any member might have made a difference, but it doesnât mean Faso couldnât have been the key. Three other Republicans had voted no because they thought the bill didnât do enough to kill the health program. Regardless of reasons, Faso could have joined them. ""He could have made the decision to kill it,"" Lukaske said. In fact, the Times Herald-Record, a newspaper covering the Hudson Valley region, had  a front page  with Fasoâs picture and the headline, ""Deciding vote,"" with a story saying the congressman kept the ""controversial health care bill alive."" The front page is shown in the DCCC ad. The committee vote was to move the bill along, a necessary step for putting the bill on the House floor. But Republican leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan acknowledged it would need changes to win full House approval. When the Budget Committee voted, the bill had provisions calling for reducing Medicaid payments to states. It had language eliminating penalties for people who refused to buy health insurance. It called for changing the subsidy system for those buying coverage. And it would have relaxed the rule that said insurers could charge their oldest customers no more than three times the premiums they charged their youngest ones. The  Congressional Budget Office  estimated that the bill, as it existed at that point, would have led to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018, a figure rising to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million in 2026. Democrats and health policy groups warned that if states got less money for Medicaid, they would pare back their programs, inevitably leaving some people with fewer medical services or more hurdles for enrollment. They said older customers with private insurance would face price hikes, and the subsidies to help pay would be inadequate. Republicans supporting the bill pointed out that it included money to help states stabilize their insurance markets. The CBO said states would probably use those grants ""to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims."" At this point, would the bill have killed protections for pre-existing conditions, as the DCCC claims? The answer is indirectly, it could have weakened protections -- but the question is academic because the House made changes to the bill before its May 2017 passage. One included an  amendment  allowing states to seek waivers from other ACA rules, including one that health policy groups said would have eroded requirements for providing medical services for patients who need them the most. This could lead to a new round of debate on that final House bill, but we have  covered that repeatedly  and the point here is different: The DCCC says Faso could have stopped everything with his committee vote. The DCCC says John Faso ""cast the deciding vote to deny protections for preexisting conditions."" Before we rule, itâs important to note that states had their own insurance rules before the ACA. New York already prohibited charging higher premiums based on health status.  PolitiFact looked at this  more fully when examining a related claim about Faso. We are interested here in whether Faso was the deciding vote -- whether, as the ad suggests, he could have stopped it all. We need not go far to decide, because the same kind of claim was used by Republicans against Democrats in past elections, when Republicans blasted Democrats for passing the ACA in the first place. They noted how a  procedural motion  needed for the bill passed by a single vote. Here were some of those claims: Bill Nelson ""the deciding vote"" on the health care law  (2012) Warner cast ""the tiebreaking vote"" on Obamacare  (2013) Mark Udall 'passed Obamacare with his vote'  (2014) Russ Feingold cast deciding vote on Obamacare  (2015) Thereâs more, but you get the gist. Faso was one of 19 House Budget Committee members who voted for the early version of the House repeal-and-replace bill last year. Had he voted no, things might have changed. But the same can be said for 18 others. To point out Faso as the singular villain or hero way overstates his role. Just as we did repeatedly on the ACA claim, we rate this claim Mostly False.",11/5/18,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/nov/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/whos-blame-almost-killing-obamacare-democrats-poin/,1,,John Faso voted to try to kill health care protections provided by Obamacare
"Says Claire McCaskill ""voted against including health records in the background check system.""",Hawley claim stretches McCaskill record on gun background checks .,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley told Missouri residents on live television that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill voted against the inclusion of mental health records in gun background checks. ""The (national background check system) doesnât work that well because thereâs a giant loophole right in the middle of it. It doesnât include mental health records,"" Hawley said during the second Senate debate. ""Congress could have done this, theyâve had the chance to do it, but they havenât."" ""Sen. McCaskill voted against including health records in the background check system. I think that was wrong,"" Hawley said. ""I know it was along the party line, but I think that was wrong."" Weâve fact-checked other politiciansâ statements on gun control legislation in the past, including some specifically related to firearm access for people with a history of mental illness. McCaskill has received an ""F"" rating from the National Rifle Association and taken $156,949 from gun control political action committees this election cycle, according to the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. McCaskill maintained during the debate that she supports and has voted for universal background checks. So has she or hasnât she voted against including mental health records as part of the gun-purchasing background check process? Hawleyâs evidence for McCaskillâs disapproval of including mental health records in the background check system was her vote against a 2016 amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016. Sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the proposal was one of four that came in the wake of a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub, where a gunman killed 49 people. Grassleyâs 2016 amendment would have incentivized states to submit relevant mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. ""The Democrats put the kibosh on a bill that, on its face, would have strengthened (to some degree) populating NICS database with names of persons ineligible to purchase guns on account of a mental illness disqualifier,"" said Jacob James, a professor of constitutional law and director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University, in an email. James said that Grassleyâs amendment likely didnât pass muster with Democrats like McCaskill ""because they favored a stronger gun control bill, which had no chance of passage."" Indeed, some of the leading opponents of the amendment said at the time that it did not go far enough in keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and suspected terrorists. ""It was dangerous and reckless,"" said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control Â organization that rallied against the amendment. Oransky called it a decoy to meaningful gun control legislation that would have ""invalidated hundreds of thousands of existing mental health records already in the background check system."" Representatives from gun rights advocacy groups, including the National Rifle Association, which backed Grassleyâs amendment, did not immediately respond to PolitiFactâs request for comment. The 2016 vote was similar to a failed 2013 measure co-sponsored by Grassley and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. McCaskill voted against that one, too. McCaskill voted in favor of an amendment to the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013. Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., sponsored the piece, which would have expanded background checks to gun shows and internet sales, and allotted grants ""to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health records and criminal history dispositions."" It also would have created a commission of experts charged with studying mass violence, including the role of mental health issues. The Manchin-Toomey amendment died in a Senate filibuster. In 2016, as McCaskill voted no on the Grassley amendment, she voted yes on another amendment co-sponsored by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., known as the Fix Gun Checks Act of 2016. Its purpose was to ensure that ""all individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and require a background check for every firearm sale."" Though it, too, failed to pass, the amendment also included guidelines on how to define and include relevant mental health records in the national background check system. ""Sen. McCaskill has consistently and repeatedly supported legislation to improve the federal background check system,"" said Max Samis, press secretary for gun control Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence.* Samis along with McCaskillâs campaign noted McCaskillâs co-sponsorship of a bill called the Fix NICS ACT of 2017, which aims to incentivize states to submit relevant records to the nationwide criminal background check system. After a gunman murdered 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, last February, McCaskill joined other members of Congress in saying that proposal was a start, she saw a need for gun legislation that went further. ""Itâs an important little step, but surely we can do more than the teeniest, tiniest steps right now,"" McCaskill told Politico earlier this year. Hawley said McCaskill ""voted against including (mental) health records in the background check system."" Hawley is isolating one vote from a GOP proposal while ignoring McCaskillâs full record in the Senate. McCaskill clearly has supported efforts to tighten restrictions for who can purchase a firearm, including measures that clearly addressed the inclusion of mental health records in the gun background check system and more aggressive overall provisions for regulating gun sales.

"Says ""Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on PennsylvaniaÂ streets, to prey all over this country.""",Donald Trump's wild number of sanctuary city criminal releases.,"As President Donald Trump races across the country to gin up Republican support in the midterms, he warns his audiences that Democrats are the party of crime. In Erie, Pa., Trump attacked Democratic Sen. Bob Casey for supporting a policy that Trump said put people in his own state at risk. ""Bob Casey is fighting to protect violent criminal aliens,""  Trump said Oct. 10 . ""That's what he's doing. Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country."" We decided to look at whether so-called ""sanctuary cities"" are as quick to release dangerous criminals as Trump said. They arenât. While the details vary from place to place, the term sanctuary city is shorthand for any jurisdiction that wonât hold a person at the end of their jail or prison sentence solely becauseÂ Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, wants to deport them. Trump reliably wields this against Democrats at his rallies. In  Murphysboro, Ill. , he said, ""Democrat sanctuary cities release these criminal aliens out of jail and right onto your streets."" In  Mosinee, Wisc ., he said, ""They strongly support sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal law enforcement and release known gang members, predators, criminal aliens into our communities."" We reached out to the White House for the details behind these claims and did not hear back. Specific to Casey and his voting record, based on the  Pennsylvania Republican Party website , the charge goes back to Casey not supporting a 2016 bill that would have cut federal grants to sanctuary cities. On a largely party line vote, the measure failed to clear a procedural hurdle and died. The most recent numbers from ICE paint a blurry picture of whatâs going on. In response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about gangs, particularly the violent MS-13 gang with ties to El Salvador,  ICE said there were 142 instances  where jurisdictions nationwide released known or suspected gang members. The releases took place over about nine months between October 2016 and June 2017. The agency said 15 suspected MS-13 members were released, and 127 members of other gangs. The figure are less solid than they appear. ICE noted that it couldnât say for sure that these were actual gang members, nor could it say that the releases were due to a lack of cooperation from local authorities. It told the senators that the numbers might not reflect ""potential administrative errors,"" or ""the jurisdictionâs actual level of cooperation and support."" It also said that the count included times when jurisdictions told ICE that a personâs sentence was about to end ""but ICE may not have been able to arrange a custody transfer prior to an alienâs release."" ICE press releases report instances of ignored detention requests, but  sometimes  the people are let free by local authorities and then  arrested by ICE within a day . This suggests some level of coordination that the data wouldnât capture. In March 2017,  three counties in Maryland disputed an ICE report  that said they had ignored its requests to detain certain people. They said they never received those notices. ICE has arrested people with violent criminal records after local authorities released them. For example, in 2016, New York City arrested a Mexican national for drunk driving. Some time before he had served five years for a robbery with a deadly weapon and been deported.  ICE sent a detention request Dec. 31, 2016 , the day he was released. ICE arrested him a few weeks later. Trump spoke of thousands and thousands of dangerous immigrants released in Pennsylvania and the nation overall. But with ICE counting at most 142 cases nationwide for possible gang members, and the caveats that come with that figure, thereâs no evidence for Trumpâs sky-high number for a single state. Lost in this debate are the details in the various sanctuary policies around the country. In particular, they treat dangerous criminals differently. ""A number of the sanctuary policies have carve-outs for individuals with certain types of felony offenses, and some non-felony offenses,"" said Annie Lai, clinical professor of law at the University of California Irvine. ""You want to see if the policy allows for detention for ICE, notification to ICE, transfer to ICE or transfer only with a warrant. Each of these mean different things."" California law  has a long list of crimes that give local officials the leeway to hold someone for ICE after theyâve served their time. The list includes gang-related offenses, assault, battery, sexual abuse and exploitation, rape, crimes endangering children, burglary, robbery, theft, fraud, forgery, any crime resulting in death, some domestic violence offenses, and drug and weapon-related offenses. Orange County, Calif., uses that flexibility to the utmost.  It reported that in the first five months of 2018 , it turned 316 inmates over to ICE. At the same time, it reported that it released 414 people and 45 of those were later arrested. Drug violations and resisting a police officer were the most common offenses, but two were for attempted murder. (Itâs important to note that arrests are not the same as convictions.) The point is, as a rule, sanctuary laws allow for more dangerous offenders to be held for deportation. There is no detailed Democratic policy on this. Congressional Democrats broadly favor sanctuary city policies, and  the party platform  emphasizes the deportation of ""those who pose a threat to the safety of our communities."" Former President Barack Obama  pushed for removals , and leaned on some cities, including Philadelphia, to do more to help ICE. Recent  Democratic  bills  that touch on the issue ensure that state and local law enforcement can arrest and detain ""previously-deported illegal aliens who have been convicted of a felony."" Trump said that Casey supported policies that had led to the release of ""thousands and thousands"" of dangerous criminal immigrants and ""vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania."" The White House provided no evidence to back that up. Casey opposed a bill that would have penalized cities that didnât cooperate fully with ICE. ICE reported the release of 142 suspected gang members nationwide. The agency itself gave many reasons to question the figure, including the accuracy of the count of actual gang members and the connection to sanctuary city policies. No ICE data supports Trumpâs thousands of releases in Pennsylvania or the country as a whole. Sanctuary cities' policies generally allow for detention of felons, which would include the sort of people Trump warns about. We rate this claim False.",10/31/18,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/oct/31/donald-trump/donald-trumps-wild-number-sanctuary-city-criminal-/,1,,"Bob Casey voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities that released thousands upon thousands of illegal alien criminals and vicious gang members to prey on Pennsylvania streets, to prey all over this country"
"""George Holding has voted 13 times to deny Kevin, and the 300,000 people like him in the 2nd Congressional District, coverage"" for their pre-existing conditions.",Holding voted quite consistently on healthcare bills.,"During a debate in the 2nd Congressional District in North Carolina, Republican Rep. George Holding made his stance on coverage for pre-existing health conditions clear when the topic of health care came up. ""I support protecting folks who have pre-existing conditions,"" Holding said,Â  according Â to The News and Observer. ""I donât know of any policymaker in Washington that wants to prevent people with pre-existing conditions from being able to get health care."" His Democratic challenger, Linda Coleman, thinks otherwise. Coleman named a person with a pre-existing condition and said ""George Holding has voted 13 times to deny Kevin, and the 300,000 people like him in the 2nd congressional district, coverage."" InÂ  an ad Â from Colemanâs campaign, Kevin LeCount â a friend of Colemanâs who had leukemia, according to her campaign â says, ""there are more than 300,000 people in this district, whose lives (Holding) put in danger when (Holding) voted to cut protections for people with pre-existing conditions."" The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010,Â  bans Â insurers from denying anyone coverage based on pre-existing conditions. It was legal to do so before. What has Holding voted for? There have been numerous attempts in Congress to fully or partially repeal Obamacare. They had voted 54 times through 2014 to repeal parts of the health care legislation or the whole thing, according to theÂ  Washington Post. Not all of the legislation Congress has voted on would have denied protection for people with pre-existing conditions. But some of them did, and Holding voted for some of these bills that range from budget bills defunding Obamacare to full-on repeals that would have fully eliminated protections. Bill: Date of Holding Vote: HRÂ  45 5/16/2013 HRÂ  2009 8/2/2013 H. Con. ResÂ  25 3/20/2013 3/21/2013 H. Con. Res.Â  96 4/10/2014 4/10/2014 HRÂ  596 2/3/2015 H. Con.

Res.Â  11 4/30/2015 H.R.Â  3762 10/23/2015 1/6/2016 2/2/2016 We found that Holding has voted 14 different times for bills that affect pre-existing conditions in some way. Of these bills, four were budget bills that would have defunded Obamacare. Only the budget bills fromÂ  2015 Â andÂ  2016 Â mentioned protections for pre-existing conditions by saying the protections should be included in any future health care reform. Since these bills didnât provide a clear path to offering protections, people with pre-existing conditions could have been vulnerable until other health care legislation passed. Two budget bills fromÂ  2013 Â andÂ  2014 Â were full repeals of Obamacare, and did not promise protections for pre-existing conditions. Any full repeal of Obamacare would also fully repeal these protections. It is important to note that budget bills are not binding on policy, so it does not mean a vote for these will automatically repeal or defund Obamacare One bill would have prevented the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing any of the tax mandates necessary for funding Obamacare. .Holding also voted in favor of aÂ  reconciliation Â bill, which is a budget bill that does not allow for filibusters in the Senate. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit with a focus on health policies,Â  notes Â that this bill does not allow insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Tim Jost , a law professor at Washington and Lee University, said in an email that this reconciliation bill would not have fully repealed Obamacare or protection for those with pre-existing conditions. That doesnât mean things wouldâve stayed the same. ""[The repeal] would have made it much harder for people with lower incomes to afford coverage for pre-existing conditions,"" Jost said. Holdingâs defense All of these votes came while President Barack Obama was in office, and Congress had no chance at successfully repealing Obamaâs signature health legislation. The Republicans were well aware of that. Their repeal attempts were used to show they could organize as a party, and could get the job done if there was a Republican president. The game changed when President Donald Trump was elected. The Republican-controlled Congress pushed out its first health care bill. It wouldâve fully repealed Obamacare and replaced it with theÂ  American Health Care Act . On May 4, 2017, HoldingÂ  voted forÂ  this bill. During the debate, Holding cited his votes for the AHCA to prove he supported protections for people with pre-existing conditions. ""I really do want to put this pre-existing conditions argument to rest. I voted to repeal Obamacare as many times as I was given an opportunity to vote for repealing Obamacare,"" Holding said. ""... Obamacare didnât work. The American Health Care Act would work, and it protects and gives coverage to people with pre-existing conditions."" A previousÂ  fact check Â found that the AHCA says insurers wouldnât have been able to limit access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions. It wouldâve cut back on protections, however, by allowing for insurers to raise premiums based on an individualâs health status. OurÂ ruling Holding voted numerous times on bills that affect the Affordable Care Act in some way. We found eight bills would have either affected protections for pre-existing conditions, or fully removed them. None of the budget bills Holding voted for were binding either, meaning they wouldnât have necessarily defunded or repealed Obamacare. Holding voted on two budget bills that promised protections in future health care reform, but they offered no replacement. When he did vote for a replacement, the AHCA, it would have allowed insurers to raise premiums for people based on their pre-existing conditions. We rate this claim Mostly True.

"Says Beto OâRourke ""voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation.""",Mostly False: Donald Trump claim that Beto O'Rourke voted to shield MS-13 members from deportation.,"President Donald Trump, stirring Texas supporters, charged Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto OâRourke with voting to shield violent gang members from deportation. Trump, urging voters at an Oct. 22, 2018, Houston rally to re-elect his onetime nemesis, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that OâRourke, the third-term congressman from El Paso who opposes Trumpâs avowed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, ""even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."" Trump went on: ""He doesnât want to deport them. He says theyâre people, theyâre people. They carve you up with a knife but theyâre people."" So, did OâRourke vote to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation? We didnât get a White House reply to our request for Trumpâs factual backup. But we identified a 2017 House vote on a proposal related to deporting or not admitting criminal gang members to the United States. OâRourke and an outside expert subsequently told us the Texanâs vote didnât shield MS-13 members from deportation, which happens regularly under current law. Whatâs MS-13? Itâs a misconception that MS-13 members hail entirely from abroad in that the violent group started in Los Angeles where many refugees from civil strife in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua fled in the 1980s. In 2017, the Justice Department  said  there are an  estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members  operating in at least 40 states. Members are concentrated in Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington, D.C., the  New York Times  reported in March 2018. The  Times , citing federal authorities, said the gangâs 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico. MS-13 stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which comes from the words ""mara,"" a Spanish term for gang, ""salva,"" for El Salvador, and ""trucha,"" slang for cunning. The ""13"" refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or ""M,"" which denotes the gangâs allegiance to the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang, DOJ said. In 2012, MS-13  became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization  when President Barack Obama did so. Our October 2018  search  of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website yielded more than 270 web pages detailing actions against MS-13 members----including arrests, criminal convictions and removals. A 2017 House vote Another web search led us to see that the House in September 2017 voted mostly along party lines to send the Senate the  Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act . As of October 2018, it still hadnât received Senate consideration. In a  news story Â at the time,  The Washington Post  said that the proposal ""would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members, regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime."" Advocates said the move would enhance public safety. Before the vote, the White House issued a  statement  saying advisers would urge Trump to sign the measure into law should the House version reach his desk. That statement credited the proposal with giving ""law enforcement needed tools to help ensure that criminal alien gang members are deported quickly and never again allowed to enter the United States."" Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union said the measure ""would promote racial profiling, erode due process and unintentionally affect others, such as clergy who try to help gang members,"" the Post story said. Immigrant advocates maintained ""it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport, detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committed,"" the story said. By our read, the legislation would enable federal officials to designate criminal gangs, defined as five members or more bent on criminal activity, and permit a consular or law enforcement official not to admit a person to the U.S. if the official knows or has reason to believe the individual is or has been in a criminal gang--with no requirement that the individual have criminal convictions. Also, the legislation permits immigration authorities to start deportation proceedings against anyone in the U.S. believed to be or have been in a criminal gang. OâRourkeâs nay Next, we confirmed from a  roll call vote  that OâRourke was among 174 Democrats to vote against the measure, which won House approval by 233-175. Rep.  Justin Amash  of Michigan was the sole Republican to vote ""no."" In floor debate, a co-sponsor of the proposal, Rep.  Raul Labrador , R-Idaho, said that without the legislation, MS-13 members could legally stay in the U.S. unless they were convicted of deportable offenses, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. If the legislation became law, Labrador told members, ICE would newly ""be permitted to place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of being criminal gang members"" as determined by specifications in the measure of crimes considered to be gang related, Labrador said. Labrador also said: ""I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not allow that."" Under the measure, he said, ICE would have the burden of proof when charging an immigrant with a deportable offense. ""The government must convince an immigration judge of its case,"" Labrador said. Democratic members countered that the proposal would enable the Department of Homeland Security to deny admission to or deport any immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang affiliation, so long as DHS believes the person is associated with such a group. Under the proposal, Rep.  Zoe Lofgren , D-Calif., said, there ""is no need for conviction or even an arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of these long list of offenses,"" Lofgren said. Zofgren also suggested the legislation could lead to a religious group that aids immigrants facing charges. ""This isn't just theoretical,"" Lofgren said, going on: ""During the 1980s, members of the faith community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing transportation to undocumented immigrants."" There was a related vote. By 220-184, members rejected a Democratâs motion to have the proposal amended to bar the deportation of any person ""for action taken on behalf of a religious organization whose primary purpose is the provision of humanitarian assistance or aid."" OâRourke  voted in favor  of the motion. OâRourke campaign disputes characterization By email, Chris Evans of OâRourkeâs campaign responded to our inquiry about Trumpâs claim by disputing the presidentâs characterization of OâRourke. Existing law, Evans said, ""makes immigrants who commit crimes related to gang activity deportable."" OâRourke, Evans wrote, ""believes in ensuring MS-13 members are held responsible for their crimes under our justice system and he believes in enforcing our current immigration law."" We also heard back from  David Bier , an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian-rooted Cato Institute. Bier, a former staff adviser to Labrador, called Trumpâs claim about OâRourke incorrect. Calling the legislation a ""political effort,"" Bier told us by phone that significantly, neither the White House nor other supporters of the measure had identified examples of MS-13 members the government couldnât deport without the House-approved changes in law. ""If there were any examples,"" Bier said, ""theyâd be displaying them."" Does existing law shield gang members? Stepping away from the legislation, we wondered whether existing law shields MS-13 gang members from deportation. Early this year, PolitiFact  looked into  whether MS-13 members detained in the U.S. were being let go by authorities. To the contrary,  Steve Yale-Loehr , who teaches at Cornell Law School, responded that the government by law must detain individuals who have committed certain crimes while going through deportation proceedings. He pointed out  provisions  in federal code requiring the government to take into custody any individual convicted of a range of offenses including those involving firearms, illegal drugs or aggravated assault. Yet individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Yale-Loehr said: ""If an individual caught along the border claims asylum, he or she will have their claim reviewed by an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If they can show they have a credible fear, the individual goes through the immigration court process. If they donât have a credible fear, or if an immigration judge denies their asylum claim,"" they will be deported, Yale-Loehr said. But immigration experts said that itâs difficult for gang members to receive asylum. Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, said: ""If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum."" If a gang member or criminal can somehow make a substantive case that their asylum argument should be heard, the immigrant would be allowed to stay in the United States until their hearing. They would typically post a bond to do so. Critics call this wrinkle ""catch and release."" Yale-Loehr said Border Patrol agents and ICE officials can release people in this way, under what is known as prosecutorial discretion. In addition, immigration judges can allow immigrants in deportation proceedings to be released after they pay a bond, if they meet certain conditions. ""But that is happening less and less often under the current administration, and the government is certainly not required to release people who may be deportable, Yale-Loehr said in February 2018. He cited a Department of Homeland Security  memo  that drastically cut back on the practice in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated. Our ruling Trump said OâRourke ""voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."" We see an element of truth to this claim because OâRourke did not vote for a Trump-backed measure pitched as easingÂ deportations of suspected criminal gang members. But we spotted no evidence that OâRourkeâs ""no"" was a vote to shieldÂ violent gang members from deportation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"Say Maine U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin ""voted to gut your retirement benefits.""",Maine Democratic Party overstates Poliquin's plans.,"Whatâs the difference between a trim, a cut or a jagged, painful gutting? The Maine Democratic Party prompts such a question, thanks to a mailer it sent to homes in much of the state. It accuses Bruce Poliquin, the incumbent Republican in Maineâs expansive 2nd Congressional District, of ""voting to gut your retirement benefits."" The flyer then breaks this down, saying Poliquin has ""turned his back on us by: ""Voting to gut Social Security ""Supporting a raises in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security. ""Voting to cut $500 billion from Medicare ""Voting for a tax plan that rewards his donors but adds nearly $2 trillion to the debt, and will force cuts to Social Security and Medicare."" Thatâs enough to make any retiree frugal, and by necessity, too. But it also appears to be overkill. Hereâs why. Some of the adâs claims are based on a series of votes by Poliquin to approve tax cuts and a federal budget blueprint. Poliquin supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced individual and corporate income tax rates. The Maine Democratsâ flyer provides footnotes to explain how this could affect Social Security and Medicare, and how the tax plan helped Poliquinâs donors. The $1.5 trillion tax package was promoted as a way to propel the economy, because companies would have more money to invest and hire, and families would have more disposable income. Poliquinâs donors presumably supported the cuts, but it is impossible to say whether his retiree-donors â who have given more than $368,468 for his re-election â like them more or less than people behind the business PACs that have given him $1.25 million, or any other donors who helped make up his $3.6 million campaign chest, as of Sept. 30. The only thing certain about that is, according to the Urban-Brookings  Tax Policy Center , about 45 percent of the tax cut benefits go to the top 5 percent of earners in the first year, and by 2027, 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent. The tax cuts were paid for through borrowing, and that borrowing will help push annual deficits to over $1 trillion by the year 2020, the Congressional Budget Office says. The CBO agrees that the tax cuts will ""increase the supply of labor and capital in the economy, thereby raising potential output."" But counting interest, the tax cuts will nevertheless add a  cumulative $1.9 trillion  to the federal debt over the course of 10 years, the CBO projects. Democrats said from the start that the loss of tax revenue was certain to bolster Republicansâ calls for cuts to Social Security and Medicare, which the GOP says are otherwise unsustainable. Together, they account for  about 40 percent  of all federal spending. In fact, in early December, 10 days before the House vote on tax cuts, U.S. News reported that House Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress would ""have to get back next year at entitlement reform"" in order to tackle the debt and the deficit. The Democratsâ worries over this were bolstered recently when on Oct. 16, less than two weeks after the Maine Democrats approved their mailer and prepared to send it to homes, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said spending on the retirement programs would need to be contained. McConnell blamed federal spending, not the tax cuts, for the problem. So how severe could this containment be, and would it amount to a gutting? McConnell and other Republicans have discussed for several years the possibility of shrinking the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not gutting it. Based on public discussions, this would involve delaying or trimming benefits for future retirees, not current ones. This leads to the second part of the Maine Democratsâ claim â that Poliquin ""has turned his back on us"" by ""supporting a raise in the retirement age and capping cost of living increases for Social Security."" The Democrats cited a  YouTube video  from a 2011 breakfast speech to the Portland, Maine, Community Chamber of Commerce in which Poliquin, then the state treasurer, discussed a $4.3 billion shortfall in the stateâs pension fund for teachers and state workers. To deal with it, he supported a proposal to limit cost-of-living increases for current retirees, require higher payments into the fund by those still working, and delay retirement â until age 65 âÂ by workers there less than five years. That was a state pension issue, not a Social Security one. In Maine, employees in the public pension system donât pay into Social Security and generally donât draw its benefits. But the next year, when Poliquin ran unsuccessfully in a primary for U.S. Senate, he  was quoted  in National Review as saying he had a plan for saving Social Security: ""The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits."" The other part of the Democratsâ claim is that Poliquin voted ""to cut $500 billion from Medicare."" This is based on his vote in 2017 for a nonbinding House budget blueprint that laid out Republican priorities, including cutting $487 million from the growth rate of Medicare over a decade. To make this cut, the House would gradually raise Medicareâs eligibility age, which is now 65, or lower than Social Securityâs age for full benefits (which is now 66 and moving slowly to age 67). The Republican plan called for a ""premium support"" program, which means seniors would get a voucher so they could pick among private insurance plans or stick with traditional Medicare. PolitiFact in 2017  looked at a similar proposal  from Senate Republicans â who called for a Medicare cut of $473 billion â and determined it would provide the program with 5.5 percent less than if Medicare continued at its current projected spending rate. The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin ""voted to gut your retirement benefits."" Technically, Poliquin did not vote to do anything to Social Security, although a discussion about cuts is likely. As he said in 2012 of Social Security, ""The way to do it is raise the retirement age for new entrants and also slow down the rate of growth of benefits."" Similarly, he voted for a budget blueprint that, while not binding, called for getting more insurers involved in Medicare, offering a ""premium support"" for it and gradually raising the programâs eligibility age.

"Says Ted Budd ""voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions â¦ letting insurance companies deny coverage for (necessary) treatment.""",Fact-checking Kathy Manningâs ad on Ted Budd and pre-existing conditions.,"Two years ago, Republicans were attacking Democrats for backing the Affordable Care Act. But the tables have turned. These days, Democrats across the country are citing the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and blasting Republicans for their repeated efforts to chip away at it. In North Carolinaâs 13th Congressional District, which includes Statesville, High Point and parts of Greensboro, a 30-second  television ad  from Democratic congressional candidate Kathy Manning targets incumbent Republican Rep. Ted Budd for his vote on a ""repeal and replace"" bill. The ad cites the case of a woman named Lilly who ""worked her way through UNC while living with a tumor that radiation and surgery could not cure."" ""But Lillyâs congressman, Ted Budd, voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions like hers, letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment she needs,"" the ad says. Budd is not the first Republican to see this attack. In the last several weeks, PolitiFactâs state affiliates have awarded Half True ratings to nearly identical ads and statements from Democrats in  Wisconsin ,  Florida ,  Virginia  and  California . Manningâs ad has been  active on Facebook  for more than a month, and the Manning campaign even set up a special  website  to showcase it. So we decided to give it a fresh look and see how it stacks up against the facts. The Manning campaign declined to comment, but its  website  cited articles from  Time ,  CNN  and the  AARP  to back up the claim. The website noted that the vote in question was related to the  American Health Care Act of 2017 , a Republican plan to overhaul Obamacare. The AHCA, as the bill was called, passed the House with a  217-213  margin before ultimately failing in the Senate. The AHCA would have retained some components of Obamacare while eliminating the individual mandate and making other modifications. Budd voted yes on the AHCA, and while it did not allow states to refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, it did open the door for insurers to hike premiums for those people under certain circumstances. Specifically, an April 2017  amendment  from Rep. Tom MacArthur, R-N.J., would have allowed states to apply for waivers to some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. As PolitiFact noted in its  guide  to the MacArthur amendment, the amendment would have let states seek waivers from the AHCAâs ""continuous coverage"" provision, which was supposed to require that Americans continuously carry health insurance or else face higher premiums for one year. Insurers in states receiving waivers would have been permitted to consider a personâs health status when setting premiums in the individual market for the year of penalty. In other words, they would have been able to raise the premiums, for one year, of a person with a pre-existing condition so long as that person had been uninsured for 63 consecutive days the previous year. Currently under Obamacare, premiums can only vary based on certain conditions, such as age, location or tobacco use. Any person without employer or government-provided health insurance is guaranteed access to coverage in the individual market â regardless of his or her health status â and cannot be charged a higher rate because of a pre-existing condition. Elizabeth Oglesby, Buddâs campaign manager, said Manningâs claim about protections for pre-existing conditions was inaccurate. ""Not one person would be denied health insurance for pre-existing conditions, and (Manning) should apologize for her false, smear campaign and take down her ad,"" she said. Indeed, the MacArthur amendment explicitly stated that ""nothing in this Act shall be construed as permitting insurers to limit access to health coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions."" But thereâs more nuance to unpack here. As we mentioned before, the amendment would have allowed insurers to consider pre-existing conditions when writing policies for people who had lapses in their coverage the previous year. The Kaiser Family Foundation  estimated  that could mean that 6.3 million people could have faced higher premiums under the AHCA because of pre-existing health conditions. Thatâs a significant number, but a small portion of the estimated 50 to 120 million people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. That means somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions could have experienced heightened premiums under the AHCA. As PolitiFact has  noted   before , many low-income people have trouble staying covered without lapses, and the waiver system could have led insurers to drive premiums too high for these people during penalty years. The ACHA would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to assist people who could not afford the penalty premiums. The waivers would have also allowed states to set up high-risk pools or participate in a federal invisible risk-sharing program to reimburse insurers for taking on high-risk individuals. Â  But itâs not clear how effective either measure would have been. In a  press release , the American Medical Association warned that the AHCAâs waiver program ""could make coverage unaffordable for people with pre-existing conditions."" Â  Thatâs why, when President  Donald Trump  and North Carolina Republican Rep.  Robert Pittenger  said the AHCA included coverage for pre-existing conditions, PolitiFact gave them both Mostly False ratings. Manningâs ad said Ted Budd ""voted to gut protections for pre-existing conditions â¦ letting insurance companies deny coverage for the treatment (Lilly) needs."" The bill included a line stating that insurers would not have been allowed to restrict access to healthcare for people with pre-existing conditions. But in a limited way, the AHCA would have rolled back protections for pre-existing conditions by letting some insurers raise premiums based on a personâs health status under certain circumstances. This could have led to somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions facing higher premiums. Â  Overall, Manningâs ad is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context. We rate this statement Half True.

"Says Dave Brat ""voted against protecting pre-existing conditions.""",Spanberger ad on Brat's vote on pre-existing conditions lacks context.,"U.S. Rep. Dave Brat has not protected health insurance rates for people with pre-existing conditions, according to Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic challenger in the 7th Congressional District. Spanberger makes the charge in a  widely-played TV ad . It features Jody Cametas, a Goochland attorney, saying her son, Mason, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when he was 10. ""He had to learn to test his blood sugar multiple times a day and give himself injections,"" Cametas says. ""And itâs so expensive that many families are sharing supplies to make ends meet. ""I feel betrayed by Dave Brat; he voted against protections for pre-existing conditions for families like mine,"" she says. The screen switches to video of Brat talking and white letters say, ""Brat VOTED AGAINST PROTECTION for pre-existing conditions."" Cametas finishes, ""I voted for Dave Brat once. I will not make that mistake again. Iâm voting for Abigail Spanberger."" Brat campaign spokesperson Katie Price has labeled the claim about the congressmanâs vote ""a lie,"" and called on Spanberger to ""correct the record immediately."" Spanberger stands by the commercial. So we investigated whether Spanbergerâs ad claim is accurate. The vote Spanberger defends her ad by citing  Bratâs vote  on May 4, 2017 for the  American Health Care Act  - a Republican bill that would have largely repealed the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House on a mostly partisan  217-213 vote , but died in the Senate. One of the most popular parts of Obamacare is a mandate that health insurers cannot reject people on the basis of pre-existing conditions - such as asthma, cancer, heart disease or diabetes - or charge them exorbitant premiums. The AHCA kept the requirement that people with pre-existing conditions be offered insurance. But it would have changed Obamacareâs rules limiting how much those people could be charged. The legislation would have allowed states to get waivers from individual requirements of Obamacare. Insurers in those states would have been permitted to raise the premiums, for one year, of people with pre-existing conditions who were uninsured for at least 63 straight days the previous year. The bill would have appropriated $8 billion over five years to help people who couldnât afford their penalty premium. After a year of paying higher rates, penalized people would have again qualify for regular rates. In other words, the bill would have allowed, in some cases, insurers to consider pre-existing conditions in writing policies. But this would have been unusual. The impact The bill would have had little effect on  153 million  Americans who get their health insurance through an employer - roughly half the population under 65. It was unknown how many states would apply for waivers. And only some of the people who buy their own insurance would have had a three-month gap in their coverage. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care,  estimated  that ""6.3 million people ""could potentially face higher premiums under the Houseâs American Health Care Act (AHCA), due to pre-existing health conditions."" Thatâs a significant number, but a small portion of all the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions (those 65 or older are eligible for Medicare, which  covers almost all  previous health issues). The Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services  estimates  that between 50 million and 129 million Americans under 65 might have a pre-existing health condition. That suggests, when combined with the Kaiserâs research, that somewhere between 4 and 13 percent of people under 65 with pre-existing conditions might have faced higher premiums under the AHCA. Our ruling Spanbergerâs ad says Brat ""voted against protecting pre-existing conditions,"" and, in a limited way, he did when he supported the AHCA. The bill would have allowed states to request a waiver from a popular Obamacare provision barring insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions. But the sweeping language in the ad makes it seem like the AHCA would affect any child or adult with a pre-existing condition, and thatâs not so. In fact, a small portion of them would have been at risk. Kaiser estimates that about 6.3 million people faced potentially higher - much higher - premiums for one year. Thatâs somewhere 4 and 13 percent of the people under 65 with pre-existing conditions. So Spanburgerâs claim is partially accurate, but omits important details and context. We rate it Half True.

"Says New Jersey Rep. Leonard Lance voted repeatedly ""to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over.""",An age claim in New Jersey leaves out something important about New Jersey.,"Older people vote, and Tom Malinowski, the Democratic challenger in New Jerseyâs 7th Congressional District, seems to have them in mind. In a television ad criticizing incumbent U.S. Rep. Leonard Lance, Malinowski says Lance voted more than 60 times ""to gut affordable health care."" These votes included provisions to let insurers deny coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, and ""to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over."" This is all about the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. The last part of the claim by Malinowski, a former U.S. State Department official, intrigued us because of a unique aspect of a New Jersey law in effect before the Obamacare was passed. It already limited how much more insurers could charge their oldest customers based on age. Those differences, however, were not quite as narrow as required by Obamacare. But letâs dispense quickly with something else first. When Malinowski says Lance, a Republican, voted more than 60 times to gut affordable health care, he is speaking of the array of votes in Congress between 2011 and 2017 concerning the federal law, passed by Democrats in Congress in 2010. Some of the votes were to fully repeal the health law. Some were to delay its implementation. Some were to eliminate or stall tax provisions within it -- to delay the IRSâ ability to penalize taxpayers who refused to get health coverage, for example, or to stop the planned taxes on durable medical equipment sales. The tax was one of the many ways the law was paid for. Lance did not go along with his party on one of its biggest, most recent bills. He voted against a repeal-and-replace measure in 2017. He said it would not adequately protect people with pre-existing conditions. But what about the age differential -- and what did it mean in New Jersey, specifically? We took a look. Older people go to the doctor more than young adults do. Thatâs a reality that affects the premiums insurers charge. As a result, insurers typically charged their oldest customers buying individual policies five times or more the premiums of their youngest adult customers before the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, according to a 2017  research report  by the actuarial firm Milliman. Georgetown Universityâs Center on Health Insurance Reforms found that people in their early 60s could face a ratio of 6-to-1, Millimanâs report noted. The ACA changed that, mandating that in the individual market, premiums for the oldest adults could be no greater than three times those for the youngest. This didnât affect large employer plans, which tend to have a range of ages that balance out big price differences anyway, and it didnât apply to Medicare, the federal program for people 65 and older. But in the individual market, it held down what would have been higher prices for the oldest buyers, while raising premiums for younger buyers. Other mechanisms in the act, particularly taxpayer subsidies to reduce out-of-pocket costs, helped temper some price changes. It bears noting that the ACA does not say a thing about the age of 50, as Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, confirmed to us. The law just refers to youngest-vs.-oldest adults. But political campaigns like to use specific ages, and 50 seems to have a meaningful resonance for voters. So what would happen if Congress got rid of the ACA? Multiple analyses say younger buyers would see premium reductions while older ones would see price spikes. This could be particularly true if older customersÂ lost one of the ACAâs other protections, a prohibition on basing premiums on medical conditions. Lance cited that concern when voting against the 2017 American Health Care Act, although he had voted for other repeal variations before then. So itâs cut and dried, right? Not quite. States used to have significant sway in how they regulated insurers, and New Jersey already limited premiums based on age. While the national average ratio of premiums for young adults to older ones was 5-to-1 or greater, New Jersey law in 2009 limited age differences to 3.5-to-1. Mathematically, thatâs 17 percent higher for the oldest customers than allowed under the ACA (which allows a rate discrepancy of 3-to-1). Thatâs not as high as rates might be if New Jersey had no cap on age differences, but it nevertheless could amount to hundreds of dollars a month, said Benji Schwartz, Malinowskiâs campaign spokesman. It is hard to determine exactly how high or low rates would be for Lanceâs constituents even with a 3.5-to-1 age ratio -- that is, even if older customers could be charged 17 percent more than younger customers -- because age was just one of the pre- and post-ACA pricing factors, Joel Cantor, director of the Center for State Health Policy at Rutgers University, told us. Other variables went into the mix. But when the ACA kicked in, ""most people saw major reductions,"" Cantor said. ""As we say, run the movie backwards and people would be hit with major premium increases,"" Cantor said. Malinowskiâs ad said that Lance voted repeatedly ""to let insurance companies charge more to people aged 50 and over."" The ad contains elements of truth but leaves out important facts: The ACA already allows insurance companies to charge older customers more â just not as much more as they did before. New Jersey limited those differences already, just not as much as the ACA. The congressional bills to change or eliminate the ACA would not have affected people on employer plans or Medicare. These factors matter.

In a long  Instagram post , Swift explained that her concern over matters of gender orientation and racism drove her to speak out. ""I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,"" Swift said.   Iâm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which Iâll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past Iâve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count.

""She voted against equal pay for women,"" Swift wrote. ""She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape."" Here, we look at whether Blackburn in fact voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn did vote against the bill, but she voted in favor of a Republican alternative. The differences were not great, but they hung on the very issue of gender orientation that Swift wrote about. The Violence Against Women Act was two decades old in 2013 when Congress wrestled with renewing the funds to support it. The law paid for programs to prevent domestic violence. It provided money to investigate and prosecute rape and other crimes against women. It supported counseling for victims. The $630 million price tag was less the problem than some specific language on non-discrimination. The Senate approved its bill first on  Feb. 12, 2013 , by a wide bipartisan margin of 78 to 22. That measure redefined underserved populations to include those who might be discriminated against based on religion, sexual orientation or gender identity. There were also changes in the recognition of the authority of Native American tribes to enforce the law within the tribal justice system. When the bill came over to the House, a key sticking point had to do with orientation and identity. House Republicans crafted a version of the legislation that omitted the sexual orientation and gender protections. The  American Bar Association opposed the GOP version , saying ""the House substitute eliminates certain critical improvements."" Domestic violence shelters in some southern states said they had heard from governorsâ offices that they couldnât use federal funds for LGBTQ victims because the law didnât explicitly say they were covered. ""You show up bleeding at the door and weâre going to address the bleeding, not stop to ask about your sexual orientation or gender identity first,"" said Ruth Glenn, CEO of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. ""We didnât want programs to lose their funding because they didnât do triage on that basis."" The House Republican version failed by a  vote of 166 to 257 . The nay votes included 60 Republicans. Blackburn voted in favor of the Republican measure. The Senate version, the one that ultimately became law, came up next and passed  286 to 138 . The bill had picked up 27 additional Republican votes. Blackburn voted no. We reached out to Blackburnâs office for comment and did not hear back. Swift said Blackburn voted against reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Blackburn voted no on the final version that became law. She did vote for a Republican alternative that lacked discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity. While there were other issues, over two dozen Republicans decided that it was better to fund the act than to continue to oppose the nondiscrimination provisions. Blackburn was not one of them.

"""I voted to defund sanctuary cities.""",McCaskill has voted for and against defunding sanctuary cities.,"While Democrats nationwide have embraced sanctuary cities, Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill is touting the opposite on the campaign trail. On Sept. 10 in a question-and-answer session at Truman State University, the senator said she ""voted to defund sanctuary cities"" when asked whether she supported them, according to a transcript by the Columbia Daily Tribune. She then talked about the importance of cooperating with law enforcement but said she empathized with children and parents separated at the border.Â Â  So-called ""sanctuary cities"" are jurisdictions that have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement particularly when concerning undocumented immigrants. But McCaskill, who is defending her seat against state Attorney General Josh Hawley, has been attacked by many conservative groups for helping sanctuary cities. So who is telling the truth? This isnât the first time McCaskill expressed her opposition to sanctuary cities. In response to an ad by One Nation, her campaign released a fact check of its own in August, stating she ""voted to crack down on sanctuary cities."" It referenced the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which reported in February that ""McCaskill was one of four Democrats who, this month, voted with Republicans to clamp down on so-called âsanctuary citiesâ during a string of failed immigration votes in the Senate."" PolitiFact looked into the specific vote in February as well as others, and we found six votes which can be grouped into three types. â¢Â    One vote on the ""cloture motion"":  This is the vote just mentioned, where on Feb. 15, McCaskill voted yes on the cloture motion for an amendment that would not allow sanctuary jurisdictions to receive various economic grants. A ""cloture motion"" is a move to end the debate and hold the final vote. This amendment failed to get enough votes to do that. â¢ Two votes on ""cloture on the motion to proceed"":  This move essentially puts the bill onto the floor for debate and consideration in the first place. In October 2015 and July 2016, McCaskill voted no on this move for two bills that would prohibit sanctuary cities from receiving certain grants. Both bills failed to get past this step.Â Â  â¢ Three votes tabling an amendment:  In 2007, 2008 and 2009, McCaskill voted to table three amendments sponsored by former Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana that would prohibit funding for sanctuary localities to develop their community policing. By definition, tabling legislation is to simply postpone consideration. But tabling legislation also effectively kills it. All three of Vitterâs amendments were tabled. It should be noted that all six votes were procedural, and none were explicitly on the actual issue itself. The question is now whether these votes should count as voting for or against an issue. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, said that ultimately these are just procedural votes. But, he added, ""procedures often help determine substantive outcomes."" Itâs along these lines that political science professor Gregory Koger of the University of Miami argues the procedural votes mentioned, by proxy, count as votes on the actual issue. ""The key question is what these votes mean in context,"" said Koger. ""What do senators think they are voting on? What are the consequences of a âyeaâ or ânayâ vote?"" Wolfensberger said procedural votes can be merely partisan rather than substantive in some cases. In the House, members of the minority party often try to delay the process even though in the end, they end up voting with the majority party. ""In deciphering procedural votes, one should look at what the legislator says, not just what they do,"" he said. It is clear, regarding the February 2018 vote, that McCaskill intended to defund sanctuary cities, citing this stance because of the murder of a Missouri man by a person staying in the country illegally. But what about the other five votes that seemed to be against defunding those cities? What was her intent back then? In a 2017 Joplin Globe article, McCaskill was reported as saying that she voted against defunding sanctuary cities because it would deter immigrants from reporting crimes. PolitiFact Missouri also reached out to the McCaskill campaign to ask for the reasoning behind those five votes. The campaign cited the community policing funding cuts and how law enforcement was against them as a reason for one of the votes. The campaign did not outrightly deny her past votes against defunding, saying that ""how she voted on other proposals does not change that fact"" she voted to defund sanctuary cities. McCaskill said she ""voted to defund sanctuary cities."" The vote her campaign references, despite being procedural, had the proxy effect of voting for the defunding, experts point out, especially considering the context where McCaskill has explicitly stated she takes that stance. The rest of her voting record, however, is against defunding sanctuary cities, and her intent back then supports the idea that those votes were substantive, too. So groups who attack her on this stance have a point. In short, she voted most recently to defund, but other votes show her defending sanctuary cities.

"Says Bruce Poliquin ""voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance.""","Did Maine's Bruce Poliquin vote to strip 117,000 people of health insurance?","Democrats are latching onto Republicansâ voting records on health care as a springboard to criticize their midterm opponents. The Maine Democratic Party picked up on that argument in a mailer on the U.S. House race in the stateâs 2nd Congressional District between Republican incumbent Bruce Poliquin and Democratic challenger Jared Golden. The mailer claims that ""Bruce Poliquinâs dangerous votes to cut health care coverage harm Maine families."" It goes on to say that Poliquin ""voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their coverage."" The attack is based on Poliquinâs votes to repeal President Barack Obamaâs Affordable Care Act and replace it the with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act, which Poliquin  voted  for in May 2017. Letâs take a look at the estimates for Maine. When we checked with the Democrats, party spokesman Chris Glynn pointed to a  Portland Press Herald   story  that references  an analysis  published in May 2017 by the  Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank. The center came up with a state-by-state estimate of coverage losses  based on a report  by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The latter report found that the American Health Care Act would increase the number of people who are uninsured by 23 million in 2026, compared to the ACA. Â  The center calculated that approximately 116,700 Mainers would see a net loss in insurance coverage under the plan by 2026. Hereâs how that breaks down: 57,300 fewer Medicaid recipients, 11,900 fewer people with employer-based coverage, and 47,500 fewer people with insurance obtained through the individual marketplace. The combined total of 116,700 represents about 9 percent of the stateâs population. The ad is based on findings of a liberal-leaning group, so we contacted other research organizations considered more moderate, such as the  Urban Instituteâs Health Policy Center. The institute produced its own study of the state-by-state implications of the AHCA. Its prediction of uninsured Mainers was half as much as the Center for American Progress. In the report, the Urban Institute  estimated  that by 2022, Maine would experience an increase in the uninsured by 56,000 people. Urban Institute fellow Linda Blumberg couldnât say exactly how the center divided up the CBO data, but explained that her organization got its estimation from a simulation that showed 23 million more people uninsured under the AHCA by 2022. The estimated effects by state varied significantly in terms of numbers and percentages, Blumberg told PolitiFact. This is a function of the distribution of health insurance coverage in each state, distribution of income, and a variety of other factors related to the population and how it varies by geographic location. In general, she said, states that had gained the most coverage under the ACA were estimated to lose the most under the AHCA. Blumberg pointed out that while CAPâs estimation is higher, both organizations find that large percentage increases in the uninsured would have occurred under the AHCA in the state of Maine, had it passed. The  Kaiser Family Foundation , also estimated that premiums would have likely gone up in large swaths of Maine (particularly in Poliquinâs district, which encompasses the entire portion of the state north of Portland and Augusta) under the AHCA, thus pricing many Mainers out of insurance. The mailer makes a blanket statement saying that Poliquinâs vote was to ""strip"" 117,000 Mainers of health coverage. It would be more accurate to say that, according to the Center for American Progress, 117,000 people could either lose their coverage, see a rise in premiums and be priced out, or be forced into an exclusion â which would limit coverage for a particular condition, but not coverage for those people entirely. Another critical part of the coverage losses in Maine would likely lie in the Medicaid cutbacks of the AHCA, which was estimated to be cut by $880 million over a 10-year span. According to the  Portland Press Herald , about 75 percent of Medicaid recipients under the stateâs ""MaineCare"" program are children, low-income senior citizens who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare, and the disabled. The Maine Democratic Party said Poliquin voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of their insurance. The group refers to his votes to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the Republican-backed American Health Care Act. The 117,000 figure comes from an analysis by the liberal Center for American Progress. It is the highest of estimates weâve found. The adâs language would lead the reader to believe that Poliquin literally voted to strip 117,000 Mainers of coverage, and that all would lose their coverage automatically. This is misleading.

"""I voted to fund President Trumpâs wall.""",Did Joe Manchin vote to fund the border wall?,"Immigration policy has been one of the most contentious issues in Congress in recent years. And a big part of that debate has revolved around President Donald Trumpâs proposed border wall. Generally, Democrats have been skeptical that a wall is needed or would work as an immigration-control measure. But Democratic senators who are up for election this year in Republican-leaning states have had to walk a political tightrope, balancing their party loyalty with their constituentsâ support for the president. In an  ad  in his reelection campaign, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said, ""I wanted Mexico to pay for the wall, but theyâre not. So we need to do it ourselves."" Despite attacks by Republicans accusing him of being soft on illegal immigration, Manchin said in the ad, ""I voted to fund President Trumpâs wall. Check the vote."" So we did. The clearest example â and the one Manchin visually highlighted in his ad â was a  bill  sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Among other things, it would have funded a border wall. Specifically, the legislation  said  that ""the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take such actions as may be necessary (including the removal of obstacles to detection of illegal entrants) to construct, install, deploy, operate, and permanently maintain physical barriers, tactical infrastructure and technology in the vicinity of the United States border to achieve situational awareness and operational control of the border and deter, impede, and detect illegal activity in high traffic areas.'' The measure also would have struck the language in an existing bill that said ""fencing and road Improvements'' and instead inserted ""physical barriers"" -- a stronger phrase, closer to the vision of a ""wall."" ""Not later than September 30, 2022, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in carrying out this section, shall deploy along the United States border the most practical and effective physical barriers and tactical infrastructure available for achieving situational awareness and operational control of the border,"" the legislation said. The legislation included other elements of Trumpâs immigration agenda, including tighter curbs on legal immigration, that made it unpalatable to most Democrats. Trump  backed this measure , and three Democrats ended up voting for it when it came up on Feb. 15, 2018, along with 36 Republicans. That was well short of a majority and much less the 60 votes required to advance the measure to a final vote. But Manchin was one of those three Democrats to vote for it. In two other instances, Manchin voted for measures that would have increased border security infrastructure such as fencing, but not precisely the wall as envisioned by Trump. One was a  bipartisan measure , informally called the Common Sense Plan, that would have implemented a path to citizenship for ""dreamers"" who were brought illegally to the United States as minors, along with funding for border security. Despite the border-security language, Trump opposed it. The  measure  would have provided $25 billion for ""the construction of physical barriers, border security technologies, and tactical infrastructure."" It said that within six months after passage, the executive branch would have to submit to Congress ""a risk-based plan for improving security along the borders of the United States, including the use of personnel, fencing, other forms of tactical infrastructure, and technology."" It won the backing of eight Republicans and 46 Democrats and Democratic-caucusing independents. Manchin voted to advance the measure to a final vote. However, it fell short of the 60 votes required for final passage. A  third measure  â and the only one to pass â was a $1.3 trillion annual federal government spending bill, of which funding for replacement border fencing was a small part. Trump has sometimes touted this bill as making progress on building his border wall, but we have found these claims  inaccurate , because the law was actually explicit about providing funding for items outside the scope of the Trump wall. The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign. The final vote for this bill was 65-32 in favor. All told, 39 Democrats voted for it, including Manchin. It can be tricky to pin down what pieces of legislation supported Trumpâs specific vision for the wall, and which supported more generic elements of border security. However, the bill Manchin highlighted in his ad -- the Grassley legislation -- received Trumpâs support, so Manchinâs vote for it was effectively a vote for Trumpâs border-security vision, however it might play out on the ground. This supports Manchinâs notion that he ""voted to fund President Trumpâs wall."" Manchinâs overall message is a shift from Trumpâs first year in office. Morriseyâs office forwarded us a  link  to an article that listed a number of instances in which Manchin spoke out against, or expressed skepticism about, the idea of a border wall. For instance, the article noted that in an interview on "" The Young Turks "" on July 11, 2017, Manchin said, ""Iâm not for building a wall. Iâm not for building a wall at all."" He also told  Politico  that month that he had ""not been supportive of funding for a wall."" Manchin said, ""I voted to fund President Trumpâs wall."" Manchin has offered various opinions about the merits of a border wall over time. However, when it came to votes, we found a clear instance in which Manchin supported a Trump-backed, hard-line immigration bill with border wall provisions that was too conservative even for a sizable portion of the Republican caucus. We rate the statement Mostly True.",10/5/18,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/oct/05/joe-manchin/did-joe-manchin-vote-fund-border-wall/,1,,Joe Manchin voted to fund President Trumps wall
"""While southern Illinois families struggled,"" Mike Bost ""voted to raise his own pay.""","In Illinois, Brendan Kelly wants to cash in on a Mike Bost vote.","In Washington, Mike Bost has agreed consistently that Congress members, earning $174,00 a year, donât need a pay raise. But the Illinois Republican spent two decades in his stateâs General Assembly before his 2014 election to Congress, and in one of those years -- 11 years ago -- he voted for a 9.6 percent pay raise for state lawmakers. You can guess where this is going. ""While southern Illinois families struggled, Bost voted to raise his own pay."" So said a campaign ad from his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly. Is this true? The suggestion is that Bost took care of himself and his lawmaker friends rather than the taxpayers. But Bostâs record of voting against pay raises is much longer. In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly was trying to pass a 75-page, multipart supplemental spending bill to fund schools, multiple state agencies and employee salaries. By the time it came up for a final vote, other lawmakers had included a measure to raise the assemblyâs pay, with rank-and-file membersâ salaries rising to $63,143 from $57,619. The Legislature had not received a raise, even one to cover cost-of-living increases, in several years, but this was controversial nevertheless because of claims that the state had bigger priorities, and limited resources. Supporters of the bill said its passage was essential -- not because of the pay raise but because the underlying bill contained multiple other state funding measures. Thatâs why Bost said he voted yes. He had voted no the previous year on a similar measure with a proposed 9.6 percent pay hike. Bost had also voted against pay raises numerous other times, his campaign and Illinois media said.  WSIL-TV , an Illinois ABC affiliate, reported that while in the Illinois Legislature, ""Bost voted against pay increases for lawmakers more than a dozen times, and even voted to require furlough days for legislators, actually reducing compensation."" The Belleville News-Democrat, examining Illinois General Assembly documents, found the same thing in its own examination. Now in Congress nearly four years, Bost has voted to freeze congressional pay 12 times. The number of votes exceeds his time in Congress because annual spending bills typically go through several stages, requiring several votes. This is about pay raises, but inflation-linked cost-of-living, or COLA, increases are also a form of a raise. Unless blocked by the Legislature, Illinois grants COLA adjustments automatically, a result of an independent compensation boardâs decision decades ago. When counting votes against pay raises, Bost and the Illinois media generally include Bostâs multiple votes to skip the COLA hikes But there was an instance in 2010, confirmed by PolitiFact in Illinois legislative records,Â when Bost voted yes on a floorÂ amendment to suspend a COLA hike and require legislators to take 12 furlough days -- yet when the measure got attached to a much broader budgetÂ bill, Bost voted no on that bill. He said he could not support the bill other reasons. Technically speaking, that meant he voted against the final legislators' COLA freeze and furlough. The same pay provisions came up the next year, however,Â in a clean bill pertaining only to lawmaker compensation -- andÂ Bost voted for the cuts. Kelly's ad says Bost ""voted to raise his own pay.""Â There is one 2007 vote that is not in question. Bostâs campaign spokesman said Bost voted for the bill despite that distasteful element, because so many other provisions were essential for the state. But Bost voted repeatedly against other pay hikes -- not only the COLAs but a 9.6 percent proposed pay hike in a 2006 bill as well. If counting, those votes outnumbered the 2007 vote. Looking at his overall record gives a very different impression.

"Says U.S. Rep. John Faso ""voted for an age tax on seniors.""","In New York, Antonio Delgado misleads in claiming John Faso voted for an 'age tax' on seniors.","Congressional hopeful Antonio Delgado is pitting U.S. Rep. John Faso against his senior constituents. The Democratic candidate is challenging the Republican incumbent for the House seat in New Yorkâs 19th Congressional District, located in the Hudson Valley and the Catskill Mountains. The district voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 by a margin of 6.8 percentage points. In a recent TV  ad , Delgado says that Faso ""paved the way for an age tax on seniors,"" while onscreen text displays that ""Faso voted for an age tax on seniors."" So did Faso vote in favor of a new ""age tax"" on senior citizens? Thatâs an exaggeration. Delgadoâs claim is a lot like  other attacks  weâve seen against GOP House members who supported the American Health Care Act in 2017, as  Faso did . (He voted in a committee that advanced the bill.) The failed attempt by Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would have allowed insurers to hike premiums for certain older enrollees from up to five times more than what they would charge younger adults. The current law sets the cap at up to three times as much. The bill also would have allowed states to set a different ratio. But the ad fails to mention a few things. It doesnât apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people over the age of 50 with medical coverage sponsored by large employers. It also wasnât a ""tax"" imposed by the government â the phrase ""age tax"" was dubbed by  AARP , because the legislation was expected to increase premiums for the elderly. And â probably most importantly in this case â it doesnât apply to New Yorkers. In a  news release , the Faso campaign argued that the plan would have had no impact on New York seniors because the state already restricts insurers from billing customers varying amounts based on age. The bill was voted into state law in the early 1990s. Faso cites the  Empire Center for Public Policy , a fiscally conservative think tank out of Albany, which marked Delgadoâs claim as ""particularly misleading in the context of New York Stateâs insurance market."" In response, Delgadoâs spokeswoman, Melissa Toufanian, said that while the age ratings wouldnât have affected New Yorkers, Faso still voted for something that would have had negative consequences for seniors across the country. We also found that when he was an assemblyman, Faso actually voted against the bill prohibiting age rating when it came across the New York State Assembly in 1992. Despite his vote, the legislation passed with bipartisan support in a 118-25 vote and was signed into law,  records show.  Â  Delgado said in an ad that opponent Faso ""voted for an age tax on seniors."" The claim refers to Fasoâs 2017 vote for the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have permitted insurers to raise premiums on individuals over age 50 up to five times more than what they charged younger adults. However, the provision didnât apply to those on Medicare, or people over the age of 50 with coverage through large employers. Also, it wouldnât have affected New York seniors, as the state has prohibited insurers from charging higher rates based on age since the early 1990s. The claim contains elements of truth but glosses over details and ignores critical facts.

"Says JackyÂ Rosen ""voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States.""",GOP super PAC ad skips over Jacky Rosen's yes vote on criminal immigrant bill.,"A  Republican super PAC ad  faults Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen for failing to take a tough line on criminals who try to sneak across the border. The $1.3 million ad buy from the Senate Leadership Fund is on the air and on the web statewide in Nevadaâs U.S. Senate race. The ad opens with images of MS-13 gang members. The violent criminal organization runs rampant in El Salvador and is a threat in communities across the United States. ""MS-13 violent gang members,"" a narrator says. ""They exploit immigration loopholes and commit vicious crimes in the U.S. Jacky Rosen, she voted against Kateâs Law, which would close immigration loopholes and help stop criminal illegal immigrants from re-entering the U.S."" The words ""Rosen voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the U.S.,"" play across the screen. We gave it a fact-check. Kateâs Law came after  32-year-old Kathryn Steinle died in San Francisco  from a shot by a Mexican national with seven felony convictions who had been deported five times. The tragic death in 2015 inflamed the debate over immigration and sanctuary cities. In June 2017, a group of four House members introduced  Kateâs Law . The bill imposed stricter penalties on people who had been deported or sent back before and tried to sneak back. Someone with three misdemeanors on their record, or a felony, could face up to 10 years behind bars. Those who had served time in an American jail faced ever increasing penalties, depending on the length of the original sentence. For a two-and-half year sentence, the maximum was 15 years. For a five-year sentence, the maximum was 20 years. And for the worst crimes, such as murder or rape, the maximum went to 25 years. ""It is already a federal crime to enter the United States without the federal governmentâs permission,"" said CÃ©sar HernÃ¡ndez, associate professor of law at the University of Denver. ""Right now, the maximum prison sentence is 20 years. Kateâs Law would increase that to 25 years, but only for people with prior convictions for a small set of serious crimes."" Kateâs Law passed the House by a 257-167 vote in June 2017 but died in the Senate. Rosen voted against it. Kateâs Law targeted repeat immigration offenders and created ever more stringent penalties based on an offenderâs past felony sentences. Under current law, the maximum penalty for any re-entry attempt is two years. Under Kateâs Law, after three attempts, the maximum rose to 10 years. It also expanded the universe of misdemeanors from drug-related under current law, to any misdemeanor, which could include offenses as common as traffic violations. ""It will discourage people from entering the United States illegally, particularly when they have already entered illegally earlier and have been convicted of a crime for doing so,"" said the billâs main sponsor,  Bob Goodlatte, R-Va ., in 2017. Although Rosen voted against Kateâs Law, she was one of 11 Democrats who voted for the  Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act  in September 2017. That bill made it easier for federal officials to detain and remove gang members. Under the bill, an official could act if he or she ""knows or has reason to believe that such person is or has been a member of a criminal gang or has participated in criminal gang activities."" The measure provided broad latitude in defining gangs and if officials had any suspicions, the person would be ineligible for asylum, temporary protected status, or special treatment because they are under 18.Â The bill passed in the House in September 2017, but has yet to win Senate approval. In White House press briefing, U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber said Kateâs Law would help prosecutors keep gang members off the streets. ""What Kate's Law does is give us one more tool that is fairly easy to use, because we're not reliant upon witnesses who may be intimidated by the gangs or victimized by the gangs,"" Huber said. ""This enables us to, based on a person's status and their criminal record and their deportation record, to simply prosecute them in federal court, obtain a prison sentence, and get them out of here."" But gang expert Robert Bunker at the University of Southern Californiaâs Safe Communities Institute said MS-13 gang members are a special case. Imprisonment is part of initiation. ""Being in prison for a gang member is considered part of âmaking one's bonesâ to gain street cred and status within the gang,"" Bunker told us. ""So, unlike cartel members who may be deterred by facing a prison sentence, a gang member â such as an MS-13 one â is not going to be deterred by it. Further, if an MS-13 gang member from Central America was ordered by his clique leader or a higher up shot-caller, to journey to the United States, they would do so. Not following orders would get them severely beaten if not killed outright."" Before Kateâs Law emerged, while deportations in general more or less held steady, people deported because of their criminal history declined. This chart comes from deportation proceedings gathered by  Syracuse Universityâs TRAC project . There are two ways to read the numbers. Itâs possible that immigrants with felonies drew less attention over the years (although during most of the period, Washington put more focus on them). But itâs also possible that current law has been effective, without the threat of Kateâs Law. Hernandez at the University of Denver said heâs not seen any study that shows a connection between increased penalties and reduced border crossings. The Senate Leadership Fund said Rosen ""voted against stopping criminals from re-entering the United States,"" citing Kateâs Law. Rosen did vote against Kateâs Law, which increased penalties for those trying to re-enter the country. However, the ad leaves out that Rosen voted in favor of another bill that specifically targeted the sort of gang members presented in the ad. The measure gave federal officers wide latitude in defining gang membership and empowered them to detain and remove any person they had reason to believe was involved with a gang. Rosenâs voting record undercuts the adâs claim.

"Says Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to ""allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycare facilities.""",Did Paul Davis vote to allow strip clubs to open nears homes and schools?,"A new  ad  from the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC working to protect the GOP Majority in the U.S. House, attacks a Kansas congressional hopeful for an incident at a strip club 20 years ago. You bet we wanted to see if the facts here stood up to scrutiny. Democrat Paul Davis is locked in a competitive race with Republican Steve Watkins in Kansasâ 2nd Congressional District, a seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and the communities west of Kansas City. The ad targets Davis for his alleged involvement in a 1998 strip club drug raid, where he was found in a dark room with a nearly naked woman. ""Whatâs worse than getting caught at a strip club during a drug bust? Ask Paul Davis."" The ad then claims Davis was found in a VIP room with a woman wearing only a G-string.Â Then it says, ""Even worse, after Davis was caught with a stripper, he voted to allow strip clubs to open near our homes, churches, schools and even daycare facilities. Shady Paul Davis canât be trusted."" Here, we are checking the details surrounding the strip club incident, along with the claim that Davis voted to allow strip clubs to operate near places like schools, homes, churches and daycares. The situation involving Davis and a strip club came to light in September 2014 during his bid for governor, which he lost. According   to   reports , Davis was getting a lap dance in a back room in the late 1990s when cops raided the club in search of drugs. He was not charged with a crime, but police involved in the raid  reported  he was found in a ""compromising position."" Davis said he ""was at the wrong place at the wrong time."" Independence Police Chief Harry Smith  later corroborated  Davisâ account that the candidate was not involved in any wrongdoing, or, to his knowledge, the focus of an investigation. He said Davis was questioned briefly before being released. Kelsi Browning, a spokeswoman for Davisâ campaign, told PolitiFact that the ad is based on something that happened 20 years ago when Davis was 26. As a new lawyer, she said, DavisÂ went with his boss to meet an ""unsavory client"" of the law firm. The ad refers to  HB 2107 , or the Community Defense Act, which was a 2011 state bill that would have prohibited strip clubs and other sexually oriented businesses from being established within 1,000 feet of the property line of an existing one as well as any schools, churches, public parks, residences, libraries or daycare centers. The bill would have also required semi-nude dancers to remain at least 6 feet away from their customers and for sexually oriented businesses to remain closed from midnight to 6 a.m. Davis was one of 28 Kansas House members who voted against the bill, which ultimately failed in the Senate. The Davis campaign says that the legislation was a perennial bill thatÂ rarely made it out of committee. When it first came up in 2010, Davis actually  voted for the bill  before it was struck down in the Senate. It came up again in the 2011 session, but this time, he voted against it. Critics of the legislation, which included Davis,  argued at the time  that regulating these businesses was best left to cities and counties. Some also questioned taking the time to focus on the issue when the state was facing a massive budget deficit. In a  Lawrence Journal-World  story around the time of the vote, Davis, who was the House minority leader, was quoted saying that the Legislature was ""probably intruding in areas where we donât need to be. Weâve got a lot more important things that we need to be dealing with here."" The Congressional Leadership Fund ad says that Kansas U.S. House candidate Paul Davis was caught with a stripper during a drug raid and later voted to allow strip clubs to open near homes, churches, schools and daycares. The ad is piecing together two unrelated issues to draw an unsavory conclusion, while embellishing parts of the story. Davis did not vote to allow strip clubs to open near schools, churches, daycares and the like. He once voted  against  a measure that would have banned them from opening near these places. He also once voted  for  the same proposal. The adâs claim that he was found in a strip club during a drug raid is accurate, but any suggestion he was connected to the drug raid is misplaced. Overall, this claim is partially accurate but takes things out of context.

"Says ""Texas U.S. Rep John Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people.""",Texas's Fletcher tries to hit Culberson on Obamacare.,"Affordable health care is a salient issue in the 2018 congressional elections, and an  ad  from a Houston Democrat has a familiar ring. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, hoping to unseat Republican U.S. Rep. John Culberson in Texasâs 7th Congressional District, says her opponent ""is taking a wrecking ball"" to a system that needs improvement, not demolition. Itâs an ad with a particular appeal to older voters, because Fletcher says in it that ""Culberson voted to let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people."" Maybe youâve heard similar claims before. Democrats across the country are using them against their Republican opponents, and PolitiFact  has checked out  many of them. But we went a little local on this one. Letâs dig in. Fletcher and other Democrats are basing this claim on provisions in the  American Health Care Act , passed by the House of Representatives along party lines on May 4, 2017. The bill was rejected in the Senate. The legislation was important for several reasons, but chiefly because it would have changed â and not simply repealed, as earlier bills had attempted â the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare. The new bill would have allowed insurers to charge certain customers over age 50 -- those buying policies in individual and small-group markets -- up to five times as much as they charge their youngest customers. Age has always factored into the price of insurance for the simple reason that older people tend to use more health care services. But the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, limited the age-to-premium ratio: The oldest insurance buyers in the individual and small group markets could be charged no more than three times the premiums as the youngest buyers. Say that premiums for a 20-year-old were $100 a month. A 60-year-old could be charged no more than $300 a month for the same policy under the ACA. Prior to Obamacare, ""premiums for older adults were typically four or five times the premiums charged to younger adults,"" the Kaiser Family Foundation said in a March  2017 report . So the Republican House bill would have lifted the age-permitted ratios closer to where they were before the Affordable Care Act. There were ifs, ands and buts concerning this proposed change. But before we get to them, letâs look at how the age change might have played out if the House bill had become law. We are able to do this because the Kaiser Family Foundation developed a data and mapping tool that allowed for illustrative comparisons of insurance policy costs under the existing and the proposed new laws. This was strictly for people buying policies on the individual market, not for employer-sponsored insurance. We ran scenarios comparing premiums for a silver-tier, or average plan, covering a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old living in Harris County, Texas â the Houston area. As commercials say, actual results might vary, and itâs worth noting that just because the law allows something, it doesnât mean every situation will match it. In the Kaiser model, premiums for the 27-year-old were $3,340 a year on the individual market under the ACA. Premiums for a 60-year-old were $8,660. That means the 60-year-oldâs premiums were about 2.6 times higher than the 27-year-oldâs. Under the House bill that Culberson supported, the 60-year-oldâs premiums would have jumped to $11,630, while the 27-year-olds would have shrunk to $3,080. That means that in this example, the 60-year-oldâs premiums would have been nearly 3.8 times as high as the 27-year-oldâs. This illustration shows premiums before accounting for taxpayer subsidies, or ""premium tax credits,"" that many buyers use to offset their costs. The ACA subsidies are based on overall income, but they also take into account federal guidelines for the maximum share of income someone should have to pay for health insurance and the cost of a benchmark plan in his or her area. The House bill that Culberson supported would have changed the subsidy system, basing it solely on age,Â although subsidies regardless of age would phase out when incomes exceeded $75,000. A number of analyses, including one from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said such a change would generally benefit younger buyers and force older buyers to pay more out of pocket for their premiums. Using the Kaiser Family Foundation data tool, we looked again at Houston scenarios for a 27-year-old and a 60-year-old each earning $40,000 a year. The 27-year-old currently doesn't qualify for a subsidy because his income is too high -- relative to the cost of hisÂ health coverage -- under the ACA. But under the 2017 House bill, he would have qualified for a $2,000 age-based subsidy. That would have reduced his out-of-pocket costs for premiums to $1,080. A 60-year-old with that same income now qualifies for a $4,580 subsidy. Under the bill Culberson supported, the age-based subsidy would be $4,000. That would put the 60-year-oldâs net premiums, after subsidies, at $7,630, seven times more than the 27-year-oldâs. Remember, the new law would limit the difference in base premiums, not the amounts due after accounting for subsidies. Would things have played out like this for sure? It depends on the moving parts. This example showed a narrower difference than five-to-one before subsidies, but actual differences change not only by region of the country but sometimes also by county. Nationally, AARP said on the day of the House vote that under the bill, unsubsidized premiums for 60- to 64-year-olds would average almost $18,000 per year, while 20- to 29-year-olds were expected to see average unsubsidized premiums of $4,010 per year. That would make the older groupâs premiums 4.5 percent higher than the younger groupâs. Fletcher was accurate in saying that Culberson voted to ""let insurance companies charge people 50 and over five times more than younger people.""

"Says U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema ""voted to cut ICE.""",Martha McSally's exaggerates Kyrsten Sinema votes on ICE funding.,"Immigration enforcement is a top issue for the border state of Arizona, and one that Republican congresswoman Martha McSally has elevated during her campaign for the U.S. Senate. In an  interview  with Fox News, McSally said that Democratic rival and U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema voted to weaken the federal agency responsible for executing immigration laws within the United States, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""This is a dangerous agenda coming out of the Democrats, and again my opponent voted to cut ICE. ... I support ICE and my opponent voted for cuts to ICE, voted not to support the Department of Homeland Security,"" McSally said in the interview that aired Sept. 16. ""She is associated with this dangerous agenda, donât be fooled by it. And thatâs a real contrast in this race as well."" McSally is on the House Homeland Security Committee and chairs the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee. Is it true that Sinema ""voted to cut ICE""? Thereâs truth to McSallyâs claim, but it leaves out important details. â¢Â Sinema voted to shift funds from ICE to other agencies. â¢Â However, Sinema also voted to increase ICEâs funding in fiscal year 2018 and, like McSally, voted in favor of a resolution supporting ICE. â¢Â Sinema said abolishing ICE ""isnât realistic and it doesnât make any sense."" McSallyâs campaign said Sinema was among Democrats who  voted in favor of an   amendment  to an appropriations bill for fiscal year 2018. That amendment, sponsored by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., sought to reduce ICE funding by $100 million and give that money to the U.S. Coast Guard. (The amendment failed.) Correa argued on the House floor that the Coast Guard should use the money for additional ships to interdict drugs coming to the United States by sea. Despite record-breaking efforts against drug trafficking, the Coast Guardâs cocaine seizures accounted for less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments, Correa said. The $100 million represented ""additional support for our border security, our high seas,"" Correa  said . He was responding to Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, who argued that the Coast Guard program was already robust and ICE money should go toward the detention of immigrants. Sinemaâs campaign argued that the $100 million redirection would have reduced an overall increase in ICE funding, but not necessarily cut it. That September, Sinema also voted  in favor of a motion  introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, to recommit a bill to the House Appropriations Committee. The intention was to get the committee to amend the bill by allocating $2.4 billion to FEMAâs National Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund. About $840 million  would have come from ICEâs budget and $1.6 billion from U.S. Customs and Border Protection's allocation for border barriers. (The motion failed.) Jackson Lee argued that instead of funding a border wall and ICE detention facilities, more money was needed for pre-disaster funding, especially in light of Hurricane Harvey's aftermath in Texas and Louisiana. ""We do not need another 10,000 beds in ICE detention centers; but we do need more than 10,000 beds in evacuation shelters,""  said  Jackson Lee. In spite of those votes, Sinemaâs spokeswoman Helen Hare said McSallyâs claim ignores a big part of the story. Sinema  voted in favor  of a  10 percent  funding increase for ICE, compared to fiscal year 2017. Sinema over her years in Congress also has  voted  in favor  of other appropriation bills   funding  ICE , her campaign said. Moreover, Sinema was one of 18 Democrats who  voted in favor  of a July resolution stating explicit support for ICE officers and personnelÂ and denouncing calls to abolish the agency. Most Democrats voted ""present."" That measure came to the floor as Republican House leaders sought to put Democrats on the record regarding their position on ICE. Sinema in July alsoÂ  told azfamily.com  that ""abolishing ICE isnât realistic and it doesnât make any sense."" While the agency removed criminal immigrants, Sinema said, ""most Americans would agree that we could use some reform."" McSally said Sinema ""voted to cut ICE."" McSallyâs evidence are votes Sinema cast on measures seeking to take funds away from ICE to give them to FEMA and the Coast Guard. But McSallyâs claim ignores Sinemaâs broader voting record. Sinema has also voted to increase funds for ICE and cast a vote supporting ICE and denouncing calls to eliminate the agency. McSallyâs claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

"Says Leah Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy.""","Like insurers, Leah Vukmir opposed Wisconsin law forcing insurers to make oral chemo more affordable.","A TV ad  by U.S. Sen.  Tammy Baldwin  attacks  Leah Vukmir , her Republican rival in the Nov. 6, 2018, election, over oral chemotherapy and insurance companies. The ad from the Wisconsin Democrat,  unveiled  Sept. 10, 2018, features a Manitowoc woman who says: Iâm 44 and I just finished my last chemo for a brain tumor. It was oral chemo, the only chemo for my kind of cancer. So, Iâm glad that Republicans and Democrats made the insurance companies in Wisconsin cover oral chemo. Who would say no to that? Leah Vukmir. She was just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies instead of the people. Leah Vukmir, you ought to be ashamed. At one point, a photo of Vukmir is shown with these words on the screen: ""Voted against oral chemotherapy."" The references are to votes by Vukmir, who is a state senator, on a bill that was later signed into law. Letâs see if Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy."" Â  All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race . The law , signed by Republican Gov.  Scott Walker  in April 2014, makes it easy for cancer patients to afford oral chemotherapy, such as the pills the woman in the ad took. It prohibits health insurance plans from charging higher copayments, deductibles or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they do for injected or intravenous chemotherapy. Before the law , health plans typically covered oral chemotherapy under prescription drug plans that could have high copays; for some health plans, those copays could run into many thousands of dollars. In contrast, chemotherapy administered at a hospital or clinic was covered as part of a health plan's standard medical coverage â with no additional cost to the patient after the deductible was reached. Like us on Facebook . Follow us on Twitter:  @PolitiFactWisc . Vukmir was one of two Republican senators to come out vocally against the bill and in support of insurers.  She said at the time : ""I have a consistent record of opposing insurance mandates. A state mandate would only impact the insurance companies regulated by Wisconsin and not those regulated at the federal level, creating an uneven playing field and driving up costs for consumers."" The bill was opposed  by the Wisconsin Association of Health Plans, an HMO trade group, as well as another trade group, the Alliance of Health Insurers, and individual insurers.  Insurers said  the measure would drive up costs on insurance premiums and make it harder for employers and consumers to afford coverage. When the measure came to a vote in the Senate, Vukmir and GOP Sen. Paul Farrow cast  the only no votes . The measure passed, 30-2. After changes were made to the bill in the Assembly, the Senate approved the bill again, 26-7.  Vukmir again voted no  because of her opposition to putting mandates on insurers; the other six senators said the changes weakened the bill. So, Vukmir was nearly alone in her opposition to an oral chemotherapy bill that was opposed by insurance companies. Her campaign told us that ""when governmentÂ mandates price structures, providers eliminate coverage optionsÂ and fewer people end up with quality care.""Â  But to be clear, her vote wasnât against oral chemotherapy, per se. Rather, the law requires that insurers treat oral chemotherapy like traditional chemotherapy when it comes to how much patients must pay. Baldwin says Vukmir was ""just about the only legislator who stood with the insurance companies"" and ""voted against oral chemotherapy."" On the main vote on a chemotherapy bill, Vukmir aligned with insurance companies that opposed the bill and was one of two state senators to vote no. That said, Vukmirâs vote wasnât against oral chemotherapy. It was against stopping insurers from charging patients higher deductibles, copayments or coinsurance for oral chemotherapy than they would pay for traditional chemotherapy.

"Says Beto OâRourke voted ""against body armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border.""",PAC backing Ted Cruz falsely says Beto O'Rourke voted against body armor for border sheriffs.,"A super PAC backing the re-election of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas portrays Democratic nominee Beto OâRourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, as careless about border security. A TV ad  from the Texans Are PAC that we spotted on Austinâs Fox 7 Sept. 12, 2018, associates OâRourke, who opposes the border-long wall sought by Republicans led by President Donald Trump, with taxpayer-funded benefits for immigrants and ""sanctuary cities,"" a term that usually refers to communities that deter local law officers from asking individuals to share their immigration status. The adâs narrator follows up the mention of OâRourkeâs support for sanctuary cities by saying, about OâRourke, ""while voting against border armor for Texas sheriffs patrolling the border."" The ad also shows these words on screen: ""No body armor for Texas sheriffs."" A 2014 House vote Fine print below the adâs mention of sheriffs and body armor helped us start our factual review. It said the claim about denying body armor to border sheriffs ties to an OâRourke vote in June 2014 on the ""Grayson Amendment."" Separately, we noticed, Cruzâs campaign posted a  press release  in May 2018 mentioning the June 19, 2014, vote on the amendment. In that  House-posted vote , OâRourke was among 62 members (counting 43 Democrats) to vote for the amendment from then-Rep.  Alan Grayson , D-Florida, which was rejected by 355 members (including 145 Democrats). Cruzâs release said ""OâRourke  voted in favor  of a bill that would prevent funding for the Defense Departmentâs Excess Personal Property Program."" The release said the program had provided law enforcement in the El Paso area with more than $9 million in equipment, including 156 units of body armor for the sheriffâs office; 90 night vision units for the local border patrol; helicopters for the city police and border patrol; and other items such as trauma gear, fencing and generators. According to  the Defense Logistics Agency, which oversees the program, more than 8,000 federal and state law enforcement agencies participate. ""Law enforcement agencies use the equipment in a variety of ways,"" the agency says. ""For instance, four-wheel drive vehicles are used to interrupt drug harvesting, haul away marijuana, patrol streets and conduct surveillance. Â The 1033 Program also helps with the agenciesâ general equipment needs, such as file cabinets, copiers and fax machines that they need but perhaps are unable to afford."" Our web search for more information about the roll-call vote cited in the Texans Are ad led us to the text of  Graysonâs failed amendment  to the Defense Departmentâs appropriations act. That text forbade expenditures toward aircraft, tanks and weaponry provided from the personal property program to local law enforcement--but it made no mention of body armor. Letâs get specific: Graysonâs amendment said that no funds made available by the act ""may be used to transfer aircraft (including unmanned aerial vehicles), armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents (including chemical agents, biological agents, and associated equipment), launch vehicles, guided missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets, torpedoes, bombs, mines, or nuclear weapons (as identified for demilitarization purposes outlined in Department of Defense Manual 4160.28) through the"" personal property program. Via the C-SPAN video archive, we  watched  Grayson present his proposal, which he said would restrict the Defense Department from militarizing community police agencies. Military weapons, he said, ""have no place in our streets regardless of who may be deploying them."" Â Two Republican members spoke in opposition before Graysonâs proposal was rejected. ""We welcome this equipment; itâs not misused,"" Rep.  Rodney Frelilnghuysen , R-N.J., said. Texans Are leader notes another House vote After weâd scoured the cited amendment, Jason Johnson, who runs the PAC, told us by email that the proposed restriction indeed extended to denying body armor to border sheriffs. He didnât say how. After we published this fact-check, we learned from the DLA that it stopped providing body armor to local jurisdictions years before the O'Rourke vote on Grayson's amendment. Spokeswoman Michelle McCaskill advised by email that the program ""stopped providing body armor in 2008. Â When DLA Disposition Services receives excess body armor from the military services, it is destroyed. What we do provide,"" McCaskill wrote, ""are tactical vests but without the body armor inserted in them. Law enforcement can purchase body armor with their own funds or with federal grant money."" Earlier, Johnson also told us that in June 2014, OâRourke voted against an amendment to the 2016 Defense Authorization Act  successfully   offered  by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin, ""that included border security activities on the list of preferred applications the Defense Department should consider when transferring excess property to other federal agencies."" We turned to the Congressional Record  transcript  of that debate to learn that for the purposes of border security, McCaulâs amendment placed the Department of Homeland Security on equal footing with other law-enforcement agencies in access to Defense Department excess equipment. The transcript shows that neither the amendment nor House floor debate touched on body armor for border sheriffs. OâRourke spoke in opposition to McCaul's amendment, it further shows, by saying DHS already had access to such equipment which, he said,Â wasnât needed on the border anyway. OâRourke said we ""do not need to militarize the border"" and he said the amendment creates ""further anxiety and fear about the border at a time that is not warranted,"" according to the transcript. The transcript shows OâRourke ultimately requested a record (rather than voice) vote on the amendment. In  that roll call vote , OâRourke was among 162 Democrats and four Republicans voting ""no"" while McCaul was among 235 Republicans plus 18 Democrats voting ""aye."" Our ruling Texans Are said OâRourke voted against providing body armor to Texas sheriffs patrolling the border. In 2014, OâRourke voted in favor of barring the Defense Department from providing excess aircraft, tanks and military weaponry to local law agencies in general. However, the proposed restriction did not extend to body armor and made no mention of border sheriffs.

"Says Steve Chabot ""voted to strip insurance protections for pre-existing conditions.""",Chabotâs votes contradict his health care talk.,"With their race squeaky tight, accusatory fingers are being pointed between Steve Chabot, the Republican incumbent in Ohioâs 1st Congressional District, and his Democratic challenger, Aftab Pureval. Two TV ads from Pureval,  one with  an on-camera assist from a mother whose now-teen-age daughter had cancer at age 7, claim that Chabot voted to strip mandatory health insurance protections for people for pre-existing conditions. That could have led to exorbitant premiums for the sickest Americans or denial of coverage altogether. Itâs as if Chabot would have punished the child throughout her life for successfully fighting cancer, the mother says in the ad. The mother, Colleen Bowman, and her daughter, Ella Bowman, now 14, are seated on a couch next to Pureval, who begins the commercial saying, ""Thank you so much for trusting me with your story."" Then over the sound of music box-like piano and violin, the mother says, ""Like I said in many letters and messages to Steve Chabot, if they take away the pre-existing condition protections, youâre punishing the child cancer survivor for surviving cancer. Thatâs pretty disgusting."" Yet thatâs exactly what Chabot would have done, Pureval contended in  a different ad  about a week earlier: ""Steve Chabot, a career politician who voted to strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions,"" that adâs announcer said. Chabot shot back in his  own ad , with an announcer saying, ""Aftab Pureval just canât seem the tell the truth. Heâs lying about Steve Chabotâs health care record."" Sounds like itâs time for a fact-check. To understand Purevalâs health care claim, we need to start with the basics of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, signed by President Barack Obama. It required most Americans to have health insurance, and health insurers had to cover any patient who applied and paid premiums. Some of those premiums were covered by taxpayer subsidies. The act, known in shorthand as both the ACA and Obamacare, prohibited charging premiums based on an applicantâs health status or prior medical conditions. It allowed insurers to charge higher premiums for their oldest members, but no more than three times as high as premiums charged for the youngest members. Republicans including Chabot disliked the ACA from the start. It was economically unsustainable, they said, and while Obama claimed premiums would go down, they went up for a number of families, and some were forced to buy coverage they didnât want. Furthermore, congressional critics said, it was an assault on the ideals of free markets and individual choice. So they tried to repeal it. They voted multiple times, generally garnering enough votes for passage in the House, which Republicans retook in the late 2010 election, but failing in the Senate. Chabot voted with the majority. Therefore, Pureval says, Chabot voted to strip protections from people with pre-existing conditions. Chabotâs record of rhetoric, however, is more complex. He has spoken about keeping protections for pre-existing conditions. Counters the Pureval campaign: Talk is cheap. Votes are what matter. In Purevalâs ad that started running Aug. 28, three of Chabotâs votes are shown scrolling down the screen. H.R. 2, the ""Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act."" The text of the bill spoke entirely of repeal and did not state a desire or intention to keep any provisions. It passed 249-189 on Jan. 19, 2011, almost entirely along partisan lines. H.R. 6079, the ""Repeal of Obamacare Act"" of 2012, cited numerous criticisms of the ACA and called for restoring pre-ACA rules as if Obamacare ""had not been enacted."" It did not discuss pre-existing conditions. The House passed it 244-185, with every Republican voting ""yes."" H.R. 569, a 2015 bill with a lengthy name but the same stated purpose: to repeal the ACA. This bill, however, spoke of ""replacement legislation"" and ordered that four separate House committees work on new components. One of provisions lawmakers would work on if the broader repeal bill passed first: ""Provide people with pre-existing conditions access to affordable health coverage."" On a partisan vote, H.R. 569 passed the House 239-186. Chabot says he never wanted to end the protection for people with pre-existing conditions. In 2017, for example, House Republicans passed H.R 1628, the American Health Care Act, with a vote of 217-213. It would give ""states the ability, if they choose, to craft health care solutions that work better for local patients, while at the same time guaranteeing that those with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied health care coverage,"" Chabot said in a statement after the vote. In 2014, Chabot endorsed a list of possible ACA alternatives, writing in the Cincinnati Enquirer that they could include ""allowing young people to stay on their parents' insurance policies until age 26 and addressing the pre-existing condition challenge."" In December 2013, Chabot and 33 other Republicans wrote to Obama seeking a meeting to discuss health care reform, with a proposed agenda that included ""guaranteeing people with pre-existing conditions can get affordable coverage."" In an ideal world, talk might equal action. But thatâs Purevalâs very contention: Despite Chabotâs talk, the incumbent voted to repeal the ACA without assuring there would be protections for people with preexisting conditions. The Cincinnati EnquirerÂ made a similar point in 2011, shortly before that first 2011 repeal vote. ""Chabot acknowledged that certain changes are needed,"" the news article said, citing Chabotâs agreement on the ""need to prohibit insurers from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions, canceling coverage once an insured person gets sick, and allow parents to keep children on their policy until age 26. ""But he acknowledged that there aren't any current plans for the House to enact those changes if a repeal passes,"" the article noted. Chabot voted for it anyway. Even the 2017 repeal-and-replace bill, the American Health Care Act, had potential weaknesses. A Columbus Dispatch article on the bill pointed out that if someone with a pre-existing condition bought a policy on the insurance exchanges ""but let it lapse for more than 63 days, the insurance company could charge a higher premium."" Similarly, the 2015 vote that required congressional committees to work on replacement bills did nothing to assure any such replacement bills would ever get a hearing, much less a vote, Sarah Topy, Purevalâs campaign manager, said in an email to PolitiFact. It was just more rhetoric, she said. Chabotâs response to all this is unusual: Yes, he voted for Obamacare repeal bills that did not include keeping protections for pre-existing conditions, but Republicans and Democrats alike knew those bills could not pass the Senate or get Obamaâs signature. Votes like this were part of a legislative strategy but, Chabotâs campaign said, few lawmakers really meant it when they said only ""repeal"" and not ""replace."" ""Here's the thing,"" Chabot campaign spokesman Cody Rizzuto said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Everyone knew that none of these votes were going anywhere as long as President Obama was in the White House."" He added that ""the votes Aftab cites were all taken while President Obama was in office. Â As such, they weren't going to be become law. Obamacare wasn't going to be repealed with President Obama's signature. Everyone knew that, and so a replacement bill wasn't necessary. You don't need a replace when there won't be a repeal."" The nature of the bills and the addition of replacement language changed, he said, once Republicans regained a Senate majority and then Donald Trump was elected president. With a real chance of passage, Rizzuto said, the bills focused more specifically on individual elements. He added that while Pureval attacked Chabot on pre-existing conditions, he did so without ever mentioning that the actual votes were on Obamacare. ""Aftab is relying on votes repealing an unpopular program, without ever mentioning that program (Obamacare),"" Rizzuto said. ""This is intentional, because tying the issue to Obamacare repeal would directly undermine his attack in this district. Â Â  Chabot has said repeatedly that he would like to have protections covering people with pre-existing conditions. When presented with bills that lacked the protections, however, he has voted for them anyway. His campaign says the votes werenât meaningful because the legislation was never going to become law and everyone knew it. We cannot say that when Congress members, elected to make laws, vote for a new law, constituents should take it with a grain of salt. There are certainly political and strategic calculations. The Truth-O-Meter can only measure what a politician says and what he or she did. The connection between the ACA and pre-existing conditions was eminently clear throughout the repeal debate.

"Says Joe Donnelly ""voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse.""",Did Indiana's Joe Donnelly vote to grant amnesty to criminals?,"A  digital ad  by One Nation, a Republican PAC, in the Indiana Senate campaign claims Democrat Joe Donnelly flip-flopped on the issue of amnesty for illegal immigrants. ""In Congress, Joe Donnelly claimed he was 100 percent opposed to amnesty and promised to send back any illegal immigrant who commits a crime,"" the narrator says as a hooded man walks along a dark sidewalk holding a knife on screen. ""But in the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse,"" the narrator continues as a man climbs over a tall fence and another is handcuffed. Donnelly has frequently stated he opposes granting amnesty to criminals. So did he really vote to let them legalize their status? The bill in question is the 2013  Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act , which gave provisional legal status to those who entered the country illegally. The legislation was a major bipartisan compromise from a group known as the Gang of 8, which included Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio. Donnelly  voted  in favor. While it passed the Senate, it never reached a vote in the House. The Donnelly campaign said Donnelly has consistently opposed amnesty and said this bill did not grant amnesty. He supported it because it increased border security. ""He only supported the 2013 bill because it wasn't amnesty and instead placed renewed focus on identifying and deporting hardened criminals -- including drunk drivers and domestic abusers,"" said Will Baskin-Gerwitz, Donnellyâs spokesman. Amnesty is a tricky word. Experts told us earned path to legalization was more appropriate in this case. In addition to border security, the bill did provide a way for people in the country illegally to apply for legal status. The bill allowed qualified unauthorized immigrants to apply for registered provisional immigrant status. After 10 years, they could apply for a green card. Eligible for that status were undocumented immigrants who had been in the United States since Dec. 31, 2011, paid their assessed taxes, passed background checks, and paid application fees and a $1,000 penalty. Prohibited from the path to citizenship were those convicted of three or more misdemeanor offenses, as well as those convicted of felonies, certain foreign offenses or unlawful voting. The ad said Donnelly granted amnesty to criminals, drunk drivers, and perpetrators of domestic violence. Thatâs not the case. Criminal is a loaded term, as it may bring to mind a person with a serious criminal record. Legally, a misdemeanor is a crime. So technically, a person with a misdemeanor would be considered a criminal. The legality of the images on screen vary. Carrying a knife isnât a crime, but stabbing someone is a felony. Trespassing is generally a misdemeanor, depending where the person is trespassing. A person with a record of two misdemeanor charges could apply for provisional legal status, while the third count would make them ineligible. As for drunk driving and domestic violence, James Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said they could be considered a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the state in which they occurred and sometimes, the level of violence. But the bill had more specific language carved out for those crimes. It said that a person with three or more drunk driving offenses was inadmissible. They would also be ineligible if they served at least one year in prison for domestic violence, or were convicted for it more than once. U.S. Rep. John Cornyn, R-Texas, introduced an amendment that curbed the criminal allowances using stronger language; anyone convicted of domestic violence or drunk driving would be ineligible. Donnelly voted againstÂ  Cornyn's Â amendment. ""Without the amendment, more individuals convicted of crimes, including domestic violence and drunk driving, would get to apply for legalization,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Experts told usÂ Cornyn's amendment was aÂ poisonÂ pill that would have made the legalization program impossible. It would have required before legalization could move forward a 90 percent apprehension rate at the Southern border. ""The 90 percent standard, for example, was intended to sink the bill by creating an impossible standard,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. ""Often these amendments are created with the intended purpose of using the motion to table vote in a campaign ad."" One Nation said, ""In the Senate, Donnelly voted to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, including criminals, drunk drivers, domestic violence, and worse."" Donnellyâs vote for the immigration bill excluded drunk drivers with multiple offenses and those convicted of domestic violence from the path to citizenship. He voted against an amendment that would have excluded more people charged with such crimes from attaining citizenship. The ad makes it seem that Donnelly purposely protected all undocumented immigrants convicted of domestic violence and drunk driving. The vote he cast still went after them, but in a less severe way than the Cornyn amendment proposed.

""Why isnât Jared Golden looking out for us?"" the ad says. ""In Augusta, Golden voted to let welfare recipients use your tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol, even lottery tickets."" The ad comes from the  Congressional Leadership Fund , a super PAC focused on strengthening and maintaining the Republican majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Golden, a state representative, is looking to unseat two-term incumbent Republican Rep. Bruce Poliquin in November. Golden  claims  the ad was is false. Letâs find out. The super PACâs claim refers to a  state law  passed in 2016 that limits people on Maine Temporary Assistance for Needy Families from using Electronic Benefits Transfer cards to purchase a laundry list of items, including tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. This state law passed Maineâs House of Representatives  206-38  with bipartisan support. Golden was one of the 38 representatives who voted against the bill. He  told the Sun Journal  he opposes misuse of welfare funds, but the state-level restrictions were unnecessary because federal rules already prohibit using welfare money for items like tattoos, tobacco and alcohol. Golden spokesman Bobby Reynolds said just because Golden voted against that bill, it doesnât mean he voted in favor of using welfare dollars for controversial purchases. Reynolds said that if the bill failed, Mainers would still be barred from using TANF funds to purchase those items under federal rules. ""It was a solution in search of a problem,"" Reynolds said. ""To be clear, Jared Golden opposes the use of SNAP and TANF for such purchases."" However, itâs worth noting that Maineâs 2016 law is more restrictive than federal law. The federal  Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012  requires states to maintain policies and practices to keep EBT cards from being used at liquor stores, casinos or adult-oriented entertainment establishments. The federal law does not restrict transactions at grocery stores that sell alcohol or that have ""gaming activities."" It also does not regulate how cash that has been withdrawn with an EBT card can be used. Maine's 2016 law also does not address cash withdrawals. ""It would be virtually impossible to effectively monitor and implement such a restriction,"" Schott said. The 2012 federal law also does not mention tattoos or tobacco. Maineâs  2016 law  expanded TANF EBT card purchase restrictions to also include tobacco products lotteries, bail, firearms, ammunition, vacation or travel services, tattoos and obscene materials or entertainment. The Poliquin campaign declined our request to comment on the content of the ad, saying the campaign had no control over the ad and no role in its creation. The Congressional Leadership Fund claims that Golden voted in favor of welfare recipients using tax dollars to buy tattoos, tobacco, alcohol and lottery tickets. Golden voted against a 2016 bill that limited EBT card purchases, saying federal law already covered the issue. Golden did not vote in favor of a measure that would expand EBT card use to those items. The statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression.

"Says Beto OâRourke ""voted against"" Hurricane Harvey ""tax relief.""",Ted Cruz says Beto O'Rourke voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims.,"Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz says in an  online video ad  that he voted for tax relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey in 2017 as his Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto OâRourke of El Paso, ridiculously voted ""no."" The narrator of Cruzâs August 2018 ad, which features photos of water rescues and Cruz on the scene of the devastating hurricane, says: ""Congressman OâRourke is so irresponsible that he even voted against hurricane tax relief."" A House roll callÂ  shows  that OâRourke, a congressman since 2013, was among 155 representatives to vote against the Houseâs Sept. 28, 2017, passage of the  Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 , for which 264 members, including 43 Democrats, cast ""yea"" votes. The same day, the House concurred with a Senate amendment to the proposal and two days later President Donald Trump signed that  into law . The measure folded in tax relief for hurricane victims. A September 2017  Houston Chronicle   news story  on the action,Â crediting Cruz with leading the effort to pass the legislation, said key provisions--approved two weeks after Congress advanced more than $15 billion in aid to Harvey victims--would permit Harvey victims to access their retirement funds penalty-free, allow victims to easily write off hurricane losses and provide a tax credit of up to $6,000 for employers who hire in a declared disaster area like Harris County, home to hard-hit Houston. Also, the story said, charitable giving might be spurred by the measure's waiving of deduction limits. Also, the proposal included language allowing taxpayers to use income from the past year to determine the Earned Income Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit, the story said. O'Rourke voted for direct aid When we asked OâRourkeâs campaign about his ""no"" vote, spokesman Chris Evans replied by email that OâRourke, who otherwise  voted for direct hurricane relief ,Â voted against the measure singled out by Cruz ""because it dramatically shortchanged Harvey victims by providing significantly smaller tax breaks than those given after Hurricane Sandy,"" which  slammed the East Coast  in 2012. Hold that comparison: The  American Institute of CPAs  put us in touch with a Louisiana expert, CPA  Jerry Schreiber , who told us by phone that Congress  didnât provide tax breaks  to victims of Hurricane Sandy. Another congressional  roll-call vote Â shows that earlier, on Sept. 25, 2017, OâRourke joined a sufficient number of House members to keep the act from being immediately considered and passed by the House. O'Rourke's explanation for opposition to tax-relief legislation After that vote, OâRourke posted a  statement  saying that he supported the measureâs main thrust--reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration and programs set to expire that week--but voted against the House moving along because ""other initiatives that are critical to the livelihood of our families and neighbors in El Paso were excluded."" OâRourkeâs statement went on: ""Without returning this legislation for further improvement, I am not confident Congress would have reauthorized these programs. ""For example, H.R. 3823 left out reauthorizing the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Community Health Centers only days before their funding is set to expire. The recent debate on health care in our country has only reinforced the need for quality, affordable care. That simply will not be possible without these two programs that so many children and families in El Paso rely on. ""Additionally, the bill would have left victims of recent natural disastersâââincluding Hurricane Harveyâââwithout sufficient assistance as they work to recover and rebuild. The bill provided help in the form of tax breaks at a much lower rate than those provided to victims of both Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina. ""Ultimately, H.R. 3823 failed to pass the House. With less than a week remaining to reauthorize the FAA, CHIP, and Community Health Centers, I urge my colleagues to pass an improved version of this legislation that extends these programs while ensuring that we continue to aid those recovering from Harvey and other recent natural disasters."" Our ruling Cruz said OâRourke irresponsibly voted against tax relief for Hurricane Harvey victims. OâRourke voted against the proposal delivering tax relief though Cruz's statement, suggesting a didn't-care attitude, leaves unsaid that OâRourke offered some reasons for his opposition and had voted for direct aid to victims.

"Says Kevin Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions.","Did Kevin Cramerâs votes harm pre-existing condition coverage for 300,000 people?","The midterm elections are dredging up talk of Obamacare once more, but the Democrats are not calling it by its name. Heidi Heitkamp, a vulnerable Democrat from North Dakota running for Senate re-election, attacked her Republican challenger in a digital ad campaign for his votes to repeal President Barack Obamaâs Affordable Care Act. Her challenger, Kevin Cramer, has been a representative for North Dakota in the House since 2013. ""This is Denise,"" Heitkamp says in the 30-second spot released on Aug. 16. ""She lives in Kildeer. Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance. For me itâs breast cancer, for Denise itâs heart disease."" ""She has something sheâd like to say to Kevin Cramer. âMr Cramer, I donât know why you voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. But I know Heidi would never do that.â "" Heitkamp is talking about several votes Cramer cast in 2013 and again in 2016 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Letâs take a look at what they did. â¢ 300,000 includes everyone with some sort of pre-existing condition. The people whose health plans might be at risk is a fraction of that. â¢ Cramer cast votesÂ to both repeal Obamacare and replace it with skimpier plans. â¢ While these replacements kept protections for pre-existing conditions in place, theyÂ stripped some of the safeguards that make those plans affordable today. The Affordable Care Act made sure that people without health insurance got coverage. The problematic sector was the individual, or non-group, market: those not covered by their employer or by the government. They form the smallest part of the market. Before the Affordable Care Act, people in that market could get turned down for having a pre-existing condition (anything from hay fever to cancer); could get charged more for it; or could be offered a health plan that excluded its coverage. Now, all of those things are illegal. The Heitkamp campaign said there are 300,000 individuals with pre-existing conditions in North Dakota, rounding the 275,556 calculated by Health and Human Services in 2009 and  316,000  calculated by the Center for American Progress. Those numbers are credible, but the majority of those individuals are covered by group plans. So voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not a vote to strip coverage from all 300,000. Instead, itÂ would jeopardize coverage for the non-group market, which covered 9 percent of North Dakotans in 2016. The ad does not make clear whether Denise is in the group or individual market. Heitkamp sent us Cramer's votes to strip funding for the Affordable Care Act and one vote to repeal it. Cramerâs campaign told us he has always supported coverage of pre-existing conditions, pointing to the American Health Care Act and  Graham-Cassidy . Whatever Cramerâs wish is, his votes jeopardize coverage as it stands for pre-existing conditions in the individual market, according to Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care organization. By the letter of the law the bills protect pre-existing conditions. But they take away the mandate that everyone be insured and the subsidies that make that affordable. In practice, plans for individuals in the nongroup market would become exorbitantly priced, if available at all. Heitkamp said Cramer voted to let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for 300,000 North Dakotans with pre-existing conditions. Cramer's votes technically included provisions to prevent health care companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.Â But the limits of what insurance companies could charge would have been watered down, which would have sent premiums skyrocketing, experts say, to the point that coverage for many would be unattainable. However, only about a tenth of the 300,000 people in the ad would be directly affected by the laws in question.

"""Congressman DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare"" and ""voted to increase the retirement age.""","Putnam ad exaggerates DeSantis votes on Social Security, Medicare.","A TV ad for Adam Putnam narrated by Florida seniors says that while President Donald Trump has their back, U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis doesnât. ""Congressman DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare,""  said one senior . ""DeSantis even voted to increase the retirement age,"" said another man. Putnam and DeSantis will face off in an Aug. 28 primary. (While the ad tries to link Putnam to Trump, the  president has endorsed DeSantis .) Multiple Democrats are also running in their own primary. The ad was referring to votes DeSantis took on budget resolutions between 2013 and 2015. DeSantis did vote on nonbinding budget resolutions that called for raising the retirement age and slowing the rate at which future spending would grow. Whether that is a ""cut"" is debatable. Putnamâs campaign cited three votes DeSantis cast in favor of budget proposals by the Republican Study Committee in  2013 ,  2014  and  2015 . All three were considered the more conservative budget proposals, and all three failed. The first thing to know about budget resolutions is that even if they pass, they arenât law. ""Resolutions themselves do nothing to change law, do nothing to change benefit levels,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ""All they do is set out a plan."" An analysis by the  Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  stated that the 2013  budget plan  transitioned Medicare to a premium support system by 2019 for new beneficiaries, and raised the Medicare retirement age to 70 and indexed it to life expectancy. It also included this policy statement: ""Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in or near retirement."" For Social Security, the proposal called for switching to another method for cost of living adjustments economists consider more accurate, known as  chained CPI , and increasing the full retirement age to 70 and indexing it for life expectancy. The budget would have led to savings relative to the baseline of $129 billion in Medicare and $126 billion in Social Security over 10 years. The legislation would have balanced the budget in four years, as opposed to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryanâs plan, which set out to balance the budget in 10 years. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget referred to these savings as ""cuts"" but that requires further explanation. To determine whether this resolution would have actually led to a cut would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that actually became law. Itâs possible to reduce futureÂ without cutting benefits seniors are getting today, Goldwein said. For example, the government could cut what it pays to providers. The proposed change to use chained CPI for inflation would not lower seniorsâ Social Security checks.Â It would mean that their checks grow at a slower rate in the future. Putnamâs ad omits that we face some challenges in funding these programs in the future. Projections show that both Medicare and Social Security lack fiscal balance. Itâs likely Congress will have to make changes to current law in the coming years. While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both, said Eugene Steuerle, a tax expert at the Urban Institute.Â ""The growth that is built into the systems like Social Security and Medicare is unsustainable,"" he said. The Republican Study Committee tried to acknowledge the problem of future insolvency, calling for Congress to come up with a plan to protect the program and those in or near retirement. DeSantis doesnât support changes to Social Security or Medicare for current recipients or those nearing retirement, said his office spokeswoman Elizabeth Dillon. She pointed to his effort to help seniors by reintroducing the  Let Seniors Work Act  in 2015, which sought to eliminate the payroll taxes for seniors. A Putnam TV ad said,Â ""Congressman DeSantis voted to cut Social Security and Medicare"" and ""voted to increase the retirement age."" DeSantis voted for three Republican Study Committee budget resolutions in 2013, 2014 and 2015 that failed. Even if they had passed, nonbinding resolutions alone do not change law, and therefore donât cut any seniorsâ benefits. Whether a vote for the resolutions is a ""cut"" depends upon how you define a cut. They were a cut in terms of the programsâ future growth relative to the baseline. But the goal of these resolutions was to persuade Congress to make changes to shore up these programs in the future to avoid steeper cuts down the road.

"""I've always voted for keeping the government open. Iâve never cast a vote to shut down the government.""",Kevin Cramer distorts record on government shutdown.,"U.S. Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he would oppose a measure to close the government following President Donald Trumpâs tweet about a possible government shutdown over immigration. Cramer, running to unseat Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, touted a clean record without any support for shutdowns. ""I've always voted for keeping the government open,"" Cramer told Robert Port on July 31. ""Iâve never cast a vote to shut down the government."" We took a closer look. Actually, thereâs no such thing as a formal ""shutdown vote,"" said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University. Rather, failure to pass appropriations bills by the start of a fiscal year or by the time temporary spending authority expires results in a shutdown. And CramerÂ has cast votes that indirectly resulted in a shutdown. The votes in question are from 2013, when Republicans in Congress fought the implementation of President BarackÂ Obamaâs Affordable Care Act by refusing to fund it. As a minority party, Republicans didn't have the numbers to change the law, and Obama and his fellow Democrats refused to agree to gut it. Following a 16-day shutdown in October 2013, lawmakers voted to fund both the government and the Affordable Care Act. ""He has voted for bills he knew would force a government shutdown because they defunded Obamacare and had absolutely no chance of passing the Senate or being signed by the president,"" said Josh Ryan, a political scientist at Utah State University. Essentially, Republicans would bring a bill to the floor to fund a narrow program or agency, Democrats would offer a motion to change the bill, and Republicans, including Cramer, would reject some of those. Most of these were procedural votes, and Cramer voted along party lines. Thereâs an element of the blame game here, too. ""Sure, Republicans may have advanced a bill that would fail and shut down the government, but then again, Democrats could vote for the bill and keep the government open,"" said Ian Ostrander, a political science professor at Michigan State University. Cramerâs office presented the same argument. ""The votes you reference were all procedural gambits to try and reopen the government that Democrats attempted to institute because they did not want to vote on the funding bills Republicans were offering, which would have funded vital parts of the government,"" Tim Rasmussen, Cramerâs campaign spokesman. This question is a little easier to answer when it comes to the U.S. Senate, because its rules structure allows for more obviousÂ delaying tactics. We rated Sen. Ted Cruzâs claim he opposed a shutdown  Pants on Fire , for example, because he voted against cloture (needed to break a filibuster) on a vote to fund the government. A senator can vote for cloture and still oppose the bill at hand, but by opposing even that, Cruz favored a shutdown over compromise. But with no filibuster in the House, itâs harder to disentangle policy positions from efforts to directly cause a shutdown. Cramer said, ""I've always voted for keeping the government open. Iâve never cast a vote to shut down the government."" We found multiple instances where Cramer indirectly helped to cause a shutdown by voting for bills that defunded Obamacare -- these bills had no chance of survival in the Senate or of being signed by then-President Obama. While Cramer'sÂ actions were not direct votes on keeping the government open, they encouraged the 2013 shutdown.

Tim Kaine for his frequent opposition to President Donald Trump. As evidence, Stewart said Kaine voted against Trumpâs proposal for a bolstered military budget. ""He has the nerve to say that he supports our military,"" Stewart said. ""President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, an yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet he even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance."" Stewart repeated similar versions of the same claim five more times during the debate. ""Earlier this year President Trump and the Republicans have proposed legislation for a 355-ship Navy, they proposed legislation that would've included another $7.1 billion of veterans care, they proposed legislation that would have increased the salaries for our military personnel, and increased the housing allowance,"" Stewart said later. ""He voted against all of it."" Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, said Stewart has been repeating the accusation for months. ""I support the military with my own flesh and blood,"" Kaine, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded. ""My boy is an infantry commander in the Marine Corps."" Kaine added that ""the record will show"" Stewartâs claims to be made-up. We decided to check the record for ourselves. When contacted for comment, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch said Kaine voted against a short-term government spending bill on Jan. 19, 2018. ""This spending bill included all of the items Corey mentioned,"" Fritsch wrote in an email. Kaine did  vote against  that  bill , a continuing resolution that would have kept the government funded through Feb. 16, 2018. Ultimately, the measure fell 10 votes short of passing and resulted in a government shutdown through Jan. 22. Before voting, Kaine issued a  joint statement  with fellow Virginia Sen. Mark Warner detailing his opposition to a bill that would mean ""punt(ing) budget discussions until mid-February."" ""Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues,"" Kaine and Warner said. In a second  statement  after the vote, Kaine and Warner explained that Virginians wanted ""a bill that funds our military, education and health care programs, extends the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, and protects Dreamers."" Despite opposing the short-term resolution, Kaine was one of 65 Senators who  voted  in favor of the omnibus spending bill â a bill packaging many smaller appropriations bills into one â that Congress approved on March 23 to fund the remainder of the fiscal year through Sept. 30. Although Fritsch pointed us to the Jan. 19 vote, Stewart  told   local news  outlets after the debate that he was referring to the March 23 omnibus spending bill in his attack on Kaine. That  bill , a 2,232-page  document  formally titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, authorized $1.3 billion in spending. Trump  signed  it into effect the same day Congress approved it, despite a last-minute veto  threat  on Twitter. In response to Trumpâs Twitter post, Kaine  blasted  the president for displaying ""the Art of the Deal-Wrecker."" After Trump signed the bill, Kaine applauded the legislation as a ""long list of wins for Virginia."" ""It will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, spur economic growth, combat the opioid epidemic, support shipbuilding and ship repair, boost defense funding, allow us to continue to protect the Chesapeake Bay, deliver affordable child care, increase accessibility to cyber scholarships, expand access to higher education, and more,"" Kaine said in a  statement . Among its many provisions, the omnibus spending bill  allocated  $700 billion for military spending, boosted military hardware, added funding for veterans care, authorized an expansion of the Navyâs fleet, raised pay for military personnel by 2.4 percent and increased funding for military housing. Ironically, Sams, the Kaine campaignâs communications director, noted that Stewart himself said he would have preferred to see the bill vetoed. ""I wish the president had vetoed it,"" Stewart  said  March 26, 2018, during a radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. ""I don't know what his calculation was â¦ they gave him a bad bill, one in which he didnât feel that he had any choice but to sign it."" Stewart called the bill ""an absolute nightmare and a disaster"" due to its high spending totals, lack of funding for the border wall, and provisions covering Obamacare, sanctuary cities, gun control and ""a sweetheart project that (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer has going up in his district."" Sams said Kaine has advocated for proposals to improve the military since Trump took office, including the Navyâs  plans  to boost its ship count from 280 to 355 over the next few decades.Â Kaine was an original co-sponsor for a 2017  act  declaring that ""it shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, at least 355 battle force ships."" In May, for example, Kaine  said  he hoped Congress would ""maintain forward motion towards a 355-ship Navy."" A month prior, Kaine said the Navyâs potential expansion to 355 ships could benefit workers. ""We talk about what 355 means for the budget, and there are a whole series of issues there, but there is a real work force need,"" Kaine  said  at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services sea power panel. ""Folks who are going to be building these ships are in pre-K right now."" Kaineâs campaign also pointed to several instances where Kaine showed support for the military, including when he  defended  increased military spending,  applauded  the Navyâs purchase of aircraft carriers and  sponsored  an amendment providing $12.3 billion for Virginia shipbuilding. Stewart said, ""President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship Navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, a yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet (Kaine) even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance."" Kaine did vote no on a short-term government spending bill, which included several of the military-related provisions Stewart cited,Â in order to signal his disapproval for another short-term budget resolution. However, Kaine eventually voted in favor of those same provisions when he said yes to the omnibus spending bill on March 23, and he has taken other actions and made other statements in support of those provisions.

"Says Sen. Bill Nelson ""voted for higher taxes"" 349 times.",Did Sen. Bill Nelson vote for higher taxes 349 times? No.,"For years, Republicans have criticized Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson for voting to raise taxes again and again. Nelson's opponent in the 2012 U.S. Senate race, Connie Mack, claimed Nelson raised taxes  150 times . That number  grew to 272  before the November 2012 election. Now, Nelsonâs current competitor, Gov. Rick Scott, is upping the ante in a new television ad. ""Forty years later, a lot of things have changed, but Bill Nelson is still in Washington,"" the narrator says. ""Still collecting a paycheck. Besides reading speeches, whatâs Nelson done all those years. 349 times heâs voted for higher taxes."" Scottâs evidence included about 349 votes Nelson cast in the Senate starting in 2001, as well as votes he took in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90). With that, we wanted to see if it was true. We have rated  similar   claims  that Nelson voted to raise taxes False because the total was bolstered by non-binding resolutions, which cannot change the tax law, and doubleÂ counted multiple votes on a single piece of legislation. Although the list is not exactly the same, we found that Scottâs team uses the same tallying tricks implemented in the past, which inflates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes. In 2012, we fact-checked Mackâs claim that Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times and ruled that claim False. Two months later, we fact-checked Mack again. This time he claimed that Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times and that also rated False. As we concluded in those checks, Mackâs list was boosted by including budget resolutions and counted multiple votes on the same piece of legislation. Scottâs 349-time claim does the same thing. More than half of votes on his list are Democratic budget resolutions, which set nonbinding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. Budget resolutions do not change tax law. Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction, offered another important distinction. ""Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is also not voting for a tax increase,"" Gordon told us. Scottâs tally makes the additional mistake of counting multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Scottâs list includes nine votes Nelson took on a 2008 budget resolution. Again, those votes do not alter how much in taxes anyone pays. Overall, we found that nearly half of all the votes Scott counted were from non-binding resolutions. The mathematical gymnastics continues in other parts of Scottâs list. Scottâs tally includes multiple votes on the other pieces of legislation. Itâs common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments. For example, in 2017, Scott counted 19 of Nelsonâs votes against  H.R. 1  â the GOP tax bill. By voting against the bill, Scottâs office argues Nelson voted for higher taxes. In reality, Nelsonâs votes would have kept the status quo. And while the tax bill that passed Congress and was signed into law cuts taxes for most Americans,  not every American is guaranteed a tax cut . Scottâs ""claim is predicated on the idea that tax cuts are âfree,â"" Joe Rosenberg, a research associate for the Tax Policy Center, said. ""The claim could equivalently be phrased as âNelson voted to reduce the federal deficit 349 times.â"" Besides tallying tricks, Scottâs statement omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. Nelson voted for President Ronald Reaganâs major tax cut package in 1981 and Nelson also voted to extend President George W. Bush-era tax cuts in 2006 and 2010. Nelson also supported the 2009 stimulus package,  which included more than $200 billion in tax cuts .

Just like Republicans in the past, Scottâs list overstates the number of times Nelson voted for higher taxes by including nonbinding budget resolutions, which accounted for almost half of the 349 votes on the list. Scott also counts multiple votes on the same piece of legislation, which further inflates the number.

"Says Ron DeSantis ""voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants.""",Putnam parrots previous absurd claim on food stamps for illegal immigrants.,"The top two Republicans running for governor in Florida, Adam Putnam and Ron DeSantis, tried to paint a picture that the other was weak on immigration issues during a nationally televised debate on Fox News June 28, 2018. Moderator Bret Baier of Fox News asked Putnam, the stateâs agriculture commissioner, to respond to a DeSantisâ attack ad calling him ""Amnesty Adam."" Putnam shot back, ""Thatâs rich for somebody who voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."" Off-screen, DeSantis, a Florida congressman who has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, responded, ""Thatâs not true, you know that, come on."" So, is that true? No, itâs not . The bill in question is  a 2014 agricultural bill , H.R. 2642. Farm bills are passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food assistance benefits, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The bill mentioned illegal immigrants briefly, in Section 4015, to mandate that states would be ""required to use an immigration status verification system"" when distributing food assistance benefits. DeSantis  voted against the bill , which passed 251-166. He also voted against a  predecessor of the bill  which failed to pass through the House, but had a similar provision against immigrants in the country illegally obtaining food assistance benefits. Putnam and his supporters frequently cite these votes as evidence that DeSantis was in favor of extending SNAP to people in the country illegally. The thinking goes that by voting against the farm bill in total, DeSantis voted against a provision that sought to verify that food assistance benefits only went to U.S. citizens. As a result, Putnam and his supporters claim, DeSantis supported distributing food assistance benefits without a citizenship test. And therefore, he supported distributing food assistance benefits to people in the country illegally. In April,  seven radio stations  have pulled a radio ad from the National Liberty Federation making the same claim as Putnam made during the Fox News debate, according to the DeSantis campaign. Even if H.R. 2642 had been voted down,  SNAP regulations  already in place prohibited people living in the United States illegally from receiving benefits. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, told PolitiFact in March 2018, ""Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens."" After the vote in 2014, DeSantis wrote  a Facebook post  clarifying his reasoning: he voted against the bill because of the high cost and low return. The bill, he wrote, is a ""bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms."" Specifically, he was concerned that the bill did not do enough to cut back the rising cost of food stamp programâa far cry from wanting to expand it to include illegal immigrants. When asked about the claim, Putnam campaign spokesperson Meredith Beatrice directed us toward DeSantisâs voting record on the 2014 bill and its predecessor, as well as a link to this similarly misleading  Central Florida Post  article . Putnam claimed DeSantis ""voted in an agricultural bill to give food stamps to illegal immigrants."" DeSantis actually voted against the bill, and explained later it had nothing to do with provisions related to immigration. Putnam has cast the vote against the farm bill as somehow allowing people living in the country illegally to receive food assistance benefits. But the practice was prohibited before the 2014 vote, and it remained prohibited after the 2014 vote.

"Says Bill Nelson voted for ""cuts to Medicare providers"" and voted to weaken ""Social Security protections"" as a U.S. senator.","Republican PAC misleads in ad about Sen. Bill Nelson's record on Social Security, Medicare.","A new ad portrays Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson as a career politician who doesnât have the backs of senior citizens. The  New Republican PAC , which is backing Gov. Rick Scott in Floridaâs closely watched Senate race, released a  30-second ad  criticizing Nelsonâs voting record in Congress. The ad juxtaposes Nelsonâs mugshots from the 1970s to the 2000s with claims about his votes on Medicare and Social Security, two federal programs that largely benefit seniors, at the time. ""Politician Bill Nelson continues to run for public office, leaving few footprints behind,"" a narrator says. ""Votes with Hillary Clinton 89 percent of the time. And raises taxes again. Cuts to Medicare providers, weakens Social Security protections."" Nelsonâs team quickly raised objections, criticizing Scott for having  ""refused"" to expand Medicaid , the federal health care program primarily serving the very poor. ""Here's the truth: No one is more committed to protecting Medicare and Social Security than Bill Nelson,"" said campaign spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. We wanted to get to the bottom of the adâs claim: Did Nelson vote to cut Medicare providers and weaken Social Security protections? The New Republican PAC cited a few votes Nelson took while in the U.S. Senate, but experts questioned whether the measures really lived up to the consequences the ad described. All in all, these were not votes geared toward making substantive, structural changes to the Social Security and Medicare programs. The PAC cited two measures that Nelson supported in 2011 and 2013 affecting Medicare. The 2011 vote was for the Budget Control Act, and the 2013 vote was for the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 . Understanding how those votes can be characterized as ""cuts to Medicare providers"" requires a lot of context and a little history lesson on the 2011  sequester . Letâs start with Nelsonâs vote on the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 , spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. The budget passed the Senate  64-36 , and every Democrat, including Nelson, voted in favor. The legislation averted a government shutdown in January 2014 by funding federal agencies and providing some relief from the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration in 2011. Hereâs the relevant background: In the summer of 2011, President Barack Obama and Congress were engaged in a high-stakes standoff over the debt limit. House Republicans insisted on spending cuts before increasing the debt limit. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner tried unsuccessfully to reach a ""grand bargain"" to put the federal budget on more stable footing. When that failed, they arrived at the much less ambitious Budget Control Act of 2011. That law included about $1.2 trillion in future budget cuts, but it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion via a bipartisan ""supercommittee."" As further incentive, the law had a threat: If a supercommittee couldnât agree on a package, or if Congress voted down the supercommittee proposal, a ""sequester"" â or across-the-board cut â would automatically go into effect, with half coming from defense. Sequestration was enacted when Congress passed the Budget Control Act in August 2011. The 2013 budget extended a  2 percent spending cut  to Medicare provider and plan payments. The liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that the 2 percent cut translated to a reduction of  $11.1 billion  for Medicare providers in fiscal year 2013. ""That means that doctors, hospitals, and providers will continue to bill Medicare in the normal way but will be reimbursed at 98 cents on the dollar, as will per-capita premium payments made to health insurance plans on behalf of Medicare participants,"" the center wrote in its analysis. So thatâs a cut, but experts suggested the ad is overplaying it. First, the cut was intended as a short-term bridge to a more permanent solution to spiraling Medicare provider costs. Second, the provision was a stopgap alternative to a much larger cut that would have gone into effect if nothing else was passed, said Stuart Guterman, a senior health care scholar at the Commonwealth Fund, which supports expanding health care access for the poor. The final Medicare physician fee schedule rule called for a 20.1 percent reduction in the fee schedule update for 2014. By passing the legislation cited in the ad, Congress was also able to block the 20.1 percent cut and replace it with a small increase for services provided through March 31, 2014. All in all, Â Joe Antos, a health policy specialist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, saidÂ ""Two percent is clearly a minor reduction."" The last point weâll make about both bills is that they were bipartisan and passed by significant margins. And  28 Republicans  including Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate GOP majority that Scott hopes to join, supported the 2011 measure. To push back on this claim, Nelsonâs camp said that he opposed cuts to Medicare in 2017 when the November  GOP tax plan  threatened to make cuts to Social Security (At the time, the CBO predicted the plan could cut  $25 billion  from Medicare.) They also pointed to legislation he sponsored such as  measure to end a Medicare policy  that causes seniors to be charged unknowingly with high costs after receiving medical care. Â  The ad hammers Nelson for harming Social Security in the 1980s and again in the 2000s, first with a ""cut"" and then by weakening its protections. Weâre focused on his Senate actions for this fact-check, but weâll explain his 1983 vote below. To support its claim, the pro-Scott group cited two votes Nelson took in  2006  and  2007 . Itâs misleading to characterize those as votes in favor of ""weakening Social Security protections."" The votes involved essentially the same measure and were introduced by the same lawmaker, then-Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. DeMintâs amendments aimed to create a reserve fund for Social Security. So, the vote wasnât explicitly looking to weaken Social Security protections. By voting against it, Nelson opposed adding something to the existing program. The amendment failed both times, with Nelson and every other Democrat voting against the measures. According to the Democrats who  voted against it , the amendment was a step toward Social Security privatization, which  critics argued  would worsen solvency, not strengthen it. Â  Supporters of the amendment, including DeMint, argued that setting up a reserve fund would stop Congress from borrowing money from the Social Security Trust Fund. Andrew Biggs, a Social Security policy specialist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the claim about Nelson ""iffy."" ""The DeMint proposal was a stalking horse for personal accounts, in the sense of setting aside money that DeMint and others would have wished to be invested in personal accounts,"" Biggs said. ""Itâs not unreasonable that someone who opposed Social Security personal accounts, as Sen. Nelson did, wouldnât favor (those) amendments."" So Nelson could counter-argue that his vote instead served to keep privatization at bay. In addition, in 2015, Nelson  cosponsored legislation  to boost Social Security and other critical benefits for seniors and more recently, he  filed legislation  to waive the 30-day requirement with respect for Social Security to ensure that residents of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands affected by hurricanes would have immediate access to Social Security benefits. He also was endorsed by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare in  April . ""Sen. Nelson has been a staunch advocate of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid since taking office in 2001,"" they wrote. ""His voting record on these issues has consistently earned him a 100 percent rating from the National Committee. The pro-Scott PAC reaches into the early years of Nelsonâs time in Washington as further evidence that he made ""cuts"" to Social Security. In 1983,  Nelson voted  for the  Social Security amendments , which were passed by bipartisan majorities and signed into law by Republican Ronald Reagan. Before the amendments passed,  actuaries warned  that Social Security payments would be unable to continue paying benefits in July 1983 unless Congress acted. The law  raised  payroll taxes, taxed Social Security benefits for some higher earners and gradually increased the full retirement age. The New Republican PAC ad said that Nelson voted for ""cuts to Medicare providers"" and voted to ""weaken Social Security protections"" as a senator in the 2000s. This claim is misleading. The votes neither weakened Social Security nor eroded the position of Medicare providers, experts said. The budget act in 2013 actually prevented a larger cut to Medicare providers, and the Social Security votes in the 2000sÂ can just as easily be portrayed as a ""stalking horse"" for personal accounts.Â  In addition, the ad ignores other actions Nelson has taken to protect Medicare and Social Security.

"Says Marsha Blackburn ""voted against military pay raise.""","Tennessee Democrats slam Blackburn on military pay vote, overlook her track record of support.","When President Donald Trump went to Nashville to boost the Senate chances of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., he praised her for being a reliable soldier for the Republican agenda. ""We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half,"" Trump said. But on one key vote, Blackburn broke with many of her Republican colleagues, and the Tennessee Democrats are chiding her for it. Blackburn was  one of 90 Republicans  to vote against a sweeping  $1.3 trillion appropriations bill  that funded agencies across the government. Inside its many pages was a 2.4 percent pay hike for the military. In an  email to the media  May 30, party spokesman Mark Brown had the subject line ""Blackburn voted against military pay raise."" The rest of the email was a copy and paste of an  op-ed in the  Tennessean  from an Army veteran who criticized Blackburn for her vote. ""This is a congresswoman that constantly touts her support for the military and veterans, so her vote against something that would improve our quality of life is both puzzling and troubling,"" the veteran wrote. We decided to give Blackburnâs voting record a closer look. Blackburn made no secret that she opposed the spending bill. At the time of the vote, she released  a statement  decrying its impact on deficits. The  Congressional Budget Office estimated  that the appropriations bill would put the country deeper in debt by many billions of dollars. ""Marsha has a record of supporting our military and veterans,"" campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler told us. ""Congressman Blackburn voted against the bloated spending package â that included a smaller military pay raise than the one she supported (2.6 percent) â because of its reckless spending."" As with any all-encompassing legislation, lawmakers will find some elements they support and others they oppose. Whichever way they vote, it is difficult to tie their decision to a specific section. In her 15 years in Congress, Blackburn has voted for appropriations bills that increased military pay at least four times, in  2004 ,  2005 ,  2007  and  2010 . The military pay hikes in those appropriations bills ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There are a number of authorization bills with pay increases that Blackburn has also supported. We counted 14 over the years, including the most recent one that passed in  November 2017  with a 2.4 percent pay hike. Authorization bills donât carry the same weight as appropriations measures, because they donât actually give agencies the green light to spend money. Despite her opposition to the latest spending bill, Blackburn welcomed Trumpâs support, and several of the victories he described at the rally, such as hikes in military spending, came out of the appropriations bill she voted against. And when the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee  Ronna McDaniel  took to Twitter to praise Trump for the military pay raises, Blackburnâs campaign retweeted the message. The Tennessee Democratic Party said that Blackburn voted against a military pay increase. Blackburn did vote no on a $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that increased pay for members of the armed forces by 2.4 percent. However, over many years, Blackburn has a consistent track record of voting in favor of pay raises for the military. To tie her recent vote to a single part of a massive spending measure leaves out a great deal of context. In this case, the legislation was estimated to add billions to annual deficits.

"Rep. Dan Donovan ""voted for Tax Cuts""","Did Rep. Dan Donovan vote for tax cuts, as Trump said?","President Donald Trump endorsed Rep. Dan Donovan for re-election, citing the Staten Island Republicanâs support for tax cuts. In a tweet, Trump praised Donovanâs record on taxes, the military and other issues. There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than  @RepDanDonovan , who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again.

""There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!"" Trump tweeted. Donovan faces a challenge from former Rep. Michael Grimm, who held the seat before Donovan won a 2015 special election. Grimm  resigned  from Congress after pleading guilty to felony tax evasion charges in 2014. Donovan trailed Grimm by 10 points in a  poll  conducted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in April. Trumpâs tweet could help narrow that gap. But is Trump right about Donovanâs record on tax cuts? Recent tax cuts A spokesperson for Trump did not get back to us with information supporting his claim, so we can't say for sure what he was talking about in his endorsement. A  search  on Twitter shows Trump tweeted about tax cuts four other times in May. Each of those tweets referred to theÂ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the federal tax law passed last year designed to lower taxes for the middle class and give major breaks to corporations and wealthy earners.Â  Donovan was one of only 13 Republicans in the House that actually voted against the law. He and four other Republicans from New York state were against a part of the bill that limited the deductibility of state and local taxes. Residents were previously allowed to deduct an unlimited amount of those taxes. The new law caps that deduction at $10,000. ""Capping this deduction â which has been a part of the U.S. tax code since 1913 â will increase taxes and harm the already-unaffordable housing market in my district,"" Donovan said in a  statement  at the time. ""With the state and local tax deduction nearly eliminated, this tax bill doesn't equal relief for far too many New Yorkers."" Past tax cuts Congress has passed other tax cuts since Donovan took office. He  voted  in favor of an omnibus spending bill that included more than  $600 billion  in tax relief in 2015. The bill permanently extended several tax breaks enacted during the Great Recession that were set to expire in 2017. The enhanced child tax credit, for example, gave couples without a tax liability a larger tax refund based on the number of children they have. The 2017 tax law allows an even larger refund for those families with the credit. The 2015 law also extended a $2,500 tax credit for low- and middle-income filers attending their first four years of college. That credit was  not changed  in the 2017 law. Other provisions of the 2015 law expanded another tax credit for low- and middle-income workers with children, allowed teachers to deduct up to $250 in school-related expenses, and extended other tax breaks Donovan also voted for a  budget bill  earlier this year that  included  more tax extenders for filers, and a bill in 2017 that gave extra tax relief to victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Our ruling Trump said Donovan ""voted for Tax Cuts."" That's actually true. Donovan has voted for tax cuts in the past, though he was against the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act last year.

Sherrod Brownâs first TV attack ad portrays his opponent U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci as a fan of lobbyists working in government. ""The U.S. Congress. Thereâs 68 teachers, 15 farmers, four pilots but only one lobbyist,"" says the  narrator  as a cash register cha-ching sound is heard in the background. ""That's right, Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress. And what's he done? He voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest."" Text on the screen shows this is a reference to the 112th Congress. That timeframe refers to January 2011 to January 2013. Democrats have long portrayed Renacci as a lobbyist. But what this ad omits is that while he was registered to lobby, there is no evidence he actually lobbied. And in fact, it wouldnât make sense for a member of Congress to work as a lobbyist at the same time. The ad also gives viewers no context about the votes cited. Brown is one of several Democratic incumbents defending a seat in a state that Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump endorsed Renacci during the primary. Before being elected to Congress, Renacci primarily worked in the private sector. He owned and operated over 60 entities, according to his Congressional biography, including nursing facilities, a CPA firm, real estate and auto dealerships. (He later said it was his experience  losing his dealership  in the auto industry bailout when General Motors closed his dealership that prompted him to run for Congress.) He also served as president on the Wadsworth City Council and then served as mayor from 2004 to 2008. In 2008, Renacci and two other individuals  registered as lobbyists  for Smokehouse International Group LTD, named for Smokerise Drive, the street on which Renacci and other partners had offices. They intended to lobby in areas including defense, aviation, homeland security, and trade, according to their  Senate lobbyist registration  forms. Renacci filed documents with the House a handful of times between 2008 and 2011 stating that he gave no political contributions while a lobbyist. His campaign spokesman, James Slepian, said that it was a mistake to file the forms since he wasnât lobbying and that it was handled by a lawyer. Slepian told us previously that two business associates wanted to form the firm and Renacci agreed to help because of his background as a CPA. The firm ""never got off the ground,"" Slepian said, ""but as a precautionary measure, one of the partners registered all three of them as lobbyists, just in case they ever took on any lobbying clients."" Brownâs campaign pointed to his lobbyist registration and a March article by the  Associated Press . The AP quoted Renacciâs attorney, Laura Mills, as stating that Renacci never lobbied. She said that he asked her office to deactivate his lobbyist registration in 2009 before he entered Congress. But the AP found that Mills didn't file the companion form required to deactivate Renacci's registration until 2011, a few months after he took office. Members of Congress canât lobby Congress or the executive branch on behalf of any private organization or individual ""as that would conflict with a Memberâs general obligation to the public,"" according to the  House Ethics manual . In addition to it being banned, it defies logic that as a House member Renacci would want to lobby himself and his colleagues as a lobbyist. As a member, he already had the power to draft legislation and seek support from other members for his priorities. This part of the ad references two votes by Renacci. The first one is fairly circuitous. The campaign pointed to Renacciâs vote on a procedural maneuver related to  HRÂ 921  on Nov. 16, 2016. The resolution related to a bill to ban U.S. bank transactions in connection with export of commercial aircraft to Iran. The resolution passed, with all of the Republicans voting in favor and all of the Democrats voting against it. If the resolution had been defeated, then the minority party â the Democrats â would have had the opportunity to decide what legislation to consider next. On the  Democratsâ plate : the  No Lobbyists on Presidential Transition Teams Act, HR 6324 . That bill, introduced by Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Md., would have prohibited the use of funds to the president-elect ""for any services or facilities provided by registered lobbyists."" The bill was in response to a move by Trump to put lobbyists in his transition team. The ad doesnât explain that Renacci never took a direct vote on lobbyist bill -- in fact, it never received any vote. Joshua Huder, a senior fellow in the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown, said that the Brown ad is relying on a hypothetical scenario about a tenuous connection. Members in the majority rarely vote ""no"" on a previous question because that would be handing off power to the minority. Thatâs something that leadership strongly discourages. The ad also cited Renacciâs vote in favor of a change to  House Ethics Rules  on Jan. 6, 2015. The vote passed  along partisan lines :Â All of the Democrats voted against it, while all but four Republicans voted for it. The new rules proposed by Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., said that a person who is a subject to a preliminary or second-phase review by the Office of Congressional Ethics shall be informed of the right to counsel and that the personâs constitutional rights canât be denied. Slepian said that Renacci ""believes in due process as enshrined in our Constitution and this measure was brought forth to ensure that due process rights are not eroded by bodies within our government."" Â  The rule change drew objections in 2015 from Craig Holman, a lobbyist at the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen. At the time, he felt the rules would inhibit the ethics committeeâs investigations. But now that more three years have passed, Holman told PolitiFact that the House rules didnât ""seem to have made much of a difference."" Brownâs TV ad said, ""Jim Renacci has been a lobbyist even while in Congress"" and ""voted to make it easier for lobbyists to hold key government positions and harder to investigate conflicts of interest."" Renacci misfiled paperwork about his lobbying activities, but thereâs no convincing evidence he actually worked as a lobbyist while a member of Congress. The statement about a vote to help lobbyists hold government positions was not a direct vote. The ad is using circuitous logic on this point. Another vote involved a rule change that drew concerns from a government watchdog at the time, but the watchdog told PolitiFact that it ultimately didnât make much difference. The statement omits critical evidence that would give a different impression.

"""Senator Cryinâ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal""",Schumer once opposed the Iran nuclear deal he now supports.,"President Donald Trump posted on Twitter last week that Sen. Charles Schumer flip-flopped on the Iran nuclear deal. The tweet came two days after Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Obama deal â a move Schumer criticized. ""Senator Cryinâ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!"" Trump  tweeted . ""Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesnât really believe that!"" Trump promised during  his campaign  to renegotiate the Iran deal, an agreement he opposed since its inception. Then-President Barack Obama announced the pact with five other countries and Iran to limit Iranâs nuclear capabilities in exchange for lighter sanctions in 2015. Is Trump right about Schumerâs record on the deal? Schumer in 2015 A spokesperson for Trump referred us to comments Schumer made about the Iran deal in 2015. Obama  announced  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or Iran nuclear deal, in July of that year. The agreement did not require a vote from Congress because it wasnât a trade deal. Past deals, like the North American Free Trade Agreement, had to be approved by Congress before they were implemented. Instead, Republicans who controlled the Senate introduced a measure to reject Obamaâs deal. Schumer came out against the deal about a month before the Senate voted on the measure. In a statement, he said he would vote against the deal for three reasons: â¢ The U.S. could not unilaterally demand inspections of Iranâs nuclear sites at any time. â¢ Iran would have more resources to develop nuclear weapons after a decade of lighter sanctions, Schumer argued. As weâve rated  before , Iran was not free to build nuclear weapons after a decade. â¢ Iran would also have more money to expand its influence in the region. The U.S. State Department has  labeled  the country a state sponsor of terrorism. Schumer wanted to keep the sanctions on Iran and pursue a different path to denuclearization. ""I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power,"" Schumer said. A few days after his break with Obama, Schumer  said  the U.S. ""should go back and try to get a better deal."" He voted to reject the nuclear agreement but Republicans in the Senate didnât have enough votes to send the measure to Obama. Schumer was one of  four  Democrats to support it. When asked after the 2016 election if he would support leaving the deal with Trump as president, Schumer told  POLITICO  he wanted to see how it played out for a few years and that ""it would be wrong to repeal it now."" Schumer in 2018 Schumer has been critical of Trumpâs decision to pull out of the deal he once opposed.

""No. There are no reports that Iran has violated the agreement and to me, the greatest worries from Iran are not right now the nuclear side,"" Schumer said,""but rather what theyâre doing in Syria, what theyâre doing to arm Hezbollah with rockets."" Schumer said he wants the U.S. to work with its allies to curb Iranâs influence in the region while maintaining the countryâs nuclear restrictions. He clarified his position on the Senate floor a few days later. ""Telling Iran, you continue giving missiles to Hezbollah, you continue sending troops to Iran, you continue your stuff with the Houthis, developing missiles, weâre going to put additional sanctions on you,"" Schumer  said . ""That to me is the smartest thing to do."" Schumer also said he did not regret voting against the deal in 2015. ""I didnât think the deal was a good deal. Proud I voted no,"" Schumer said. ""But at this time and this place for so many reasons, pulling out precipitously without our allies involved, does not achieve any of the goals we need to achieve and hurts Americans in different ways."" Our ruling Trump said Schumer wants to keep the U.S. in the Iran nuclear deal after opposing it three years ago. Thatâs all true. Schumer came out against the Iran deal and voted to reject it in 2015. He disagreed with Trumpâs decision to leave the deal this month, saying the U.S. should have threatened Iran with tougher sanctions alongside the nuclear restrictions.

"Says Dean Heller ""has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain.""",Rosen misleads on Heller Yucca Mountain vote.,"Yucca Mountain is a hot-button issue in Nevada. The idea of storing up to 110,000 metric tons of highly radioactive spent fuel from nuclear power plants has few fans inside the state. President Donald Trump supports the plan and put $110 million into his proposed budget to move it forward. With broad bipartisan support, the House voted overwhelmingly  May 10  to have the Energy Department plan and build out the storage site. Democrat Jacky Rosenâs Senate campaign fired off a press release tying incumbent Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., to the House vote. ""Heller couldnât even stop his close friend of more than a decade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, from bringing the Yucca Mountain bill to the floor for todayâs vote,"" the press release said. ""Heller has  voted for a GOP budget  that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain, and he voted to confirm President Trumpâs pro-Yucca budget director last year."" We decided to look at the statement that Heller voted for a Republican budget that advanced the Yucca Mountain waste repository. The Rosen campaignâs press release linked to an  April 12, 2011 , article in the  Las Vegas Sun . The story said a House budget provision that would have revived the Yucca Mountain proposal had died in the Senate. Thereâs a  lot of history here . With the prospect of waste building up at nuclear power plants across the country, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. In 1987, it amended the act to make Yucca Mountain the only option for Energy Department planning. Jump forward to 2009. The site had met the safety requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but the Obama administration, citing broad opposition in Nevada, put things on hold. In 2011, House Republicans added a rider to their budget that barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from doing anything to close the Yucca Mountain site. The formal text was: ""No funds ... may be used by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to conduct closure of adjudicatory functions, technical review, or support activities associated with the Yucca Mountain geologic repository license application."" So, while the bill didnât specify any particular sum to open the site, this rider denied money to roll back the planning process. The rider was part of anÂ appropriations package that reached virtually every government agency. The bill funded defense, health and human services, agriculture, and more. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the total  price tag was $1.3 trillion . Heller, then a House representative, voted for the bill, which passed pretty much down  straight party lines . Every Democrat and only three Republicans voted against it. The Rosen press release singles out the element related to Yucca Mountain, but as is always the case with budget bills, they are about much more than just one issue. Itâs also true that Heller tried to remove the Yucca Mountain rider. He offered an  amendment  that would have prevented any money going toward the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository. That amendment failed on a voice vote. Stewart Boss with the Rosen campaign said they stand by their press release. ""When a partisan budget bill with a controversial Yucca Mountain funding provision came to a vote in 2011, Senator Heller weakly tried and failed to remove the funding,"" Boss said. Heller is on the record as opposing the facility. In 2017, he  testified before a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee , saying ""This ill-conceived project would not only cause significant harm to the well-being of my home state and all Nevadans, but also poses a national security risk that is too great to ignore."" Heller has continued to argue against Yucca Mountain funding in letters to appropriators, including  this one in April . The Rosen campaign said that Heller ""has voted for a GOP bill that funded efforts to revive Yucca Mountain."" The GOP bill that got Heller's vote didnât provide money so much as it barred the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from spending money to roll back the licensing process for the waste repository site. Heller floated an amendment that would have barred spending any money on the site at all. Offering an amendment is not the same as waging a knock-down, drag-out fight, but Hellerâs amendment would have stymied the intent of the Republican language. Back then and today, Hellerâs official policy is to oppose the Yucca Mountain plan. All of this took place in the context of a massive spending measure. To focus on a single element in a $1.3 trillion bill amounts to legislative cherry-picking.

"Says Heidi Heitkamp ""cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota.""",Did Heidi Heitkamp cast 'deciding' vote on rule for energy industry?,"North Dakota Senate hopefulÂ Kevin CramerÂ called out incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp for targeting North Dakotaâs energy industry. Cramer, a Republican in the U.S. House,Â told Hugh Hewitt during a radio interview that Heitkamp, a Democrat, ""cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota."" Cramer was referring to a vote to repeal a rule from former President Barack Obamaâs Bureau of Land ManagementÂ that places limits on the amount of methane gas that can be burned off or flared at drilling sites. (When oil is extracted, raw natural gas is also brought to the surface, so plants without the technology to harness the gas flare it.) We wondered whether Heitkamp had indeed cast the deciding vote for a rule targeting North Dakotaâs oil industry. Itâs hard to say there is ever such a thing as ""the deciding vote"" with close calls in Congress. And Cramer is overplaying the ruleâs impact on North Dakota. You may not realize this, but as a nonprofit news organization,Â we depend on â and answer to â you. Your support directly impactsÂ our abilility to provide objective reporting on issues that matter.  Donate to our Spring Campaign. Go on the record as saying facts matter! The Methane and Waste Production Rule was put in place in Obama's tenureÂ and had not yet been implemented when President Donald Trump took office. The vehicle for repeal was the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to overturn regulations by federal agencies with a simply majority within 60 legislative days of their issue dates. Â  Republicans held a 52-48 edge in the Senate, and needed only a majority to repeal the rule. But the motion was defeated 49-51 on May 10, 2017. Every independent and Democrat (including Heitkamp) opposed it, joined by three Republicans âLindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, and John McCain of Arizona. Heitkamp's vote indeed was pivotal. She and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., were still publiclyÂ  undecided  on the morning of the vote. Thereâs no doubt that Heitkampâs vote was crucial. But as we  have concluded  in fact-checks of similar attacks, the ""deciding vote"" label could just as easily be applied to other lawmakers who voted no â making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the  narrowly passed  Affordable Care Act, for example.) Heitkampâs campaign argued there was a deciding vote, however, and it was McCain. ""One person surprised everybody,""Â Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.,  told  Roll Call  of McCainâs vote against the CRA. ""I was very certain the votes were there because we wouldnât bring it up if the votes werenât there."" ""In talking to folks, they were kind of going back and forth, undecided and then lean yes,"" John Hoeven, North Dakotaâs Republican senator, told  Roll Call . ""And so we actually thought we had just enough. But as it turns out, we lost three, and we didnât get any help from the Democrats."" Cramer said the rule was designed just for North Dakota. It was not. It targets flaring on all federal lands. The idea is that because the federal government receives royalties on federally owned fossil fuels, wasted methane equals lost government revenue. Republicans worried the rule was an unfair burden that would disincentivize producers. Tim Rasmussen, Cramerâs spokesman, clarified the senator was referring to the ruleâs disproportionate effect on the state. ""I would say it's designed for North Dakota because North Dakota has, over the course of this energy renaissance, the highest rates of flared natural gas in the country, BLM mineral ownership in the state making it applicable (unlike, say Texas), and just simply a widely reported on and discussed topic in the state (just like the Waters of the U.S. and Clean Power Plan),"" Rasmussen said. The law indeed impacts North Dakota for these reasons. But Alexandra Teitz, one of the ruleâs architects, said the ruleâs flaring requirements were modeled after and designed to defer to rules in place in North Dakota, which unlike other states, was already addressing the issue. Both the existing North Dakota state regulations and the bureau'sÂ rule required operators to submit gas capture plans with their applications to drill, meet monthly gas capture targets, and allowed them to exclude some flaring from the gas capture targets. In addition, theÂ rule included a key provision that allowed state requirements to substitute for the rule's requirements, if a state showed that their requirements would perform just as well in reducing waste. The bureau included this provision to avoid overlapping regulations in states that were already effectively addressing the issue. As the only state with detailed flaring requirements similar to the federal department, North Dakota would have been the ideal candidate for this provision. OtherÂ bureauÂ requirements to reduce leaks and venting would likely have stayed in place, as North Dakota has few requirements targeting those sources of waste. Teitz said that the rule would have also helped clarify regulation of flaring on tribal lands, which has been subject to some confusion. Heitkamp did express concern with the legislation and suggested alongside Manchin in a letter to Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke that it be reviewed. They wrote that the rule included some Indian lands that were not federal lands and had the potential to provide more royalties without declining oil production. Cramer said Heitkamp ""cast the deciding vote to kill the Congressional Review Act that would have repealed a BLM flaring rule that was designed just for North Dakota."" Thereâs no question that Heitkampâs vote on the repeal of the Methane and Waste Production Rule was crucial, but saying hers was the deciding vote goes too far. McCain was a last-minute holdout who bucked the majority of his party. As for its impact on North Dakota, oil is a big industry and flaring a big issue, but the rule doesnât only target North Dakota. In fact, it mirrors already existing regulations with regards to flaring, while adding related provisions and strengthening oversight. Itâs also possible that North Dakotaâs own rules on flaring could supercede the federal regulations.

"""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay.""","No, Trump didn't vote for death penalty for gay people.","A vote at the United Nations on a resolution about the death penalty has led to some inaccurate headlines about President Donald Trump. ""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay,"" said a May 7  headline  on the WashingtonSources website. The story, which  repeats a claim  circulating for months, said that the vote put the United States in the same category as China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. ( Read more  about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that the United States voted against a resolution that called for an overall ban on the death penalty, not a ban specific to gays and lesbians. The United States has said formally that it opposes the death penalty for people in same-sex relationships. While the story said that the vote ""just"" took place, it actually happened several months ago. On Sept. 29, the UN Human Rights Council voted on a broad  resolution  about the death penalty. Among other things, the resolution condemned imposing the death penalty ""as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations, and expressing serious concern that the application of the death penalty for adultery is disproportionately imposed on women."" The resolution also stated that the Secretary General had found discriminatory use of the death penalty, including based on sexual orientation. The four-page resolution includes a long list of arguments against the death penalty, and said that states that have not abolished the death penalty should ""consider doing so."" The United States was one of 13 countries to vote against the resolution, while 27 nations voted in favor and seven abstained. (The story said that Trump took the vote, but technically U.S. voting decisions are reached through internal discussions involving senior officials.) The  U.S. statement about the vote  made no specific mention of same-sex individuals. Instead, it said that the United States opposed the resolution because the resolution advocated for the outright abolition of the death penalty. ""The United States is disappointed that it must vote against this resolution. As in previous years, we had hoped for a balanced and inclusive resolution that would better reflect the position of states that continue to apply the death penalty lawfully. We reaffirm our longstanding position on the legality of the death penalty, when imposed and carried out in a manner consistent with a stateâs international obligations."" The Trump administration faced a barrage of negative headlines about the section of the resolution pertaining to people who are gay. Â  Days after the vote,  U.S. State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert  reiterated that the U.S. was against a broad condemnation of the death penalty, but also spoke up about the portion that pertained to people who are engaged in same-sex relations: ""The United States unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality, blasphemy, adultery, and apostasy. We do not consider such conduct appropriate for criminalization."" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, also pushed back against the headlines. She  tweeted  Oct. 3: ""Fact: There was NO vote by USUN that supported the death penalty for gay people. We have always fought for justice for the LGBT community."" After Nauertâs statement, some gay rights activists remained critical of the vote. The  Human Rights Campaign  stated that it ""welcomes this clarification but continues to be concerned about the Trump/Pence administrationâs engagement on the human rights of LGBTQ people abroad. It is disturbing that leadership in this administration did not discuss this position in their  original explanation for the ""no"" vote ."" According to the  International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association , as of 2017 there were six countries (eight if we count the parts of Syria and Iraq still occupied by ISIS) where the death penalty is implemented for same-sex relations. There were also five where it is technically allowed (if not actually invoked), and one where it has not yet been implemented. John Fisher, Geneva director of Human Rights Watch, an organization that opposes the death penalty, told PolitiFact that the United States made clear that it's vote against the resolution was not based on the reference to same-sex conduct. The United States has traditionally had issues with death penalty resolutions at UN forums, said Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch. ""HRC resolutions have political power in that they are expressions of a key collective body, the UNâs top human rights body,"" he said. ""But theyâre not legally binding in the way that Security Council resolutions can be."" A headline by WashingtonSources said, ""Trump votes for death penalty for being gay."" In September, the United States voted against a four-page resolution about the death penalty that included a provision condemning the imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for ""consensual same-sex relations.""Â But the U.S. had another reason to vote against the resolution: The United States still uses the death penalty, and this resolution broadly condemned it.Â Days later, the State Department went on record stating that it ""unequivocally condemns the application of the death penalty for conduct such as homosexuality.""

"Says Bill Nelson ""voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages.""",Gov. Rick Scott attack mischaracterizes vote Sen. Bill Nelson took in 2015.,"As Floridaâs U.S. Senate race heats up, Republican Gov. Rick Scott slammed Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelsonâs record on Iran. ""While Bill Nelson voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages, the following year, Governor Scott signed legislation that helped prevent state investments in Iran,"" Scott said in a press release April 30. For this fact-check, we wanted to hone in on Nelsonâs specific votes. We found that Scottâs claim mischaracterizes the vote Nelson took and leaves out that Nelson has actually advocated for the release of hostages in Iran. Nelson and Scott will face each other Nov. 6. In 2015, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a joint resolution known as the  Hire More Heroes Act of 2015.  This measure aimed to encourage small businesses to hire veterans. The bill itself had nothing to do with Israel, Iran or American hostages. But Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered up several amendments related to the Iran nuclear agreement. Often times, a member of Congress will attach an unrelated, controversial amendment in hopes of prompting debate on the amendmentâs issue, experts said. Â  And thatâs what happened when McConnell proposed  amendment 2656 . Experts told us the amendment would have jeopardized the Iran deal by blocking the president from fulfilling the commitments the United States had agreed to unless Iran met other demands outside of the dealâs terms. Specifically, the amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released Jason Rezaian, Robert Levinson, Saeed Abedini, and Amir Hekmati, and formally recognized Israel as an independent state. Nelson, along with nearly every other Democrat,Â  voted no on a cloture motion Â on McConnellâs amendment. The amendment ended up failing after the original amendment was tabled. Nelsonâs vote was technically a vote on a procedure. But Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, said the vote was essentially intended as a proxy for a vote on the amendment. More important than that, however, is the fact Scottâs claim mischaracterizes the substance of the vote. ScottÂ said Nelson voted against releasing American hostages and Iran recognizing Israel as a sovereign state, but multiple experts said the amendment was really just an attempt to kill the Iran deal. ""The vote was on whether to attach new conditions to the Iran nuclear agreement, thereby preventing the agreement from going forward,"" Koger said. Matthew Bunn, a professor of practice at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that had the amendment succeeded as intended in blocking the deal, the American hostages would almost certainly have remained in custody. He also noted that Nelson has been  among   the   most  dogged senators in pursuing the release of the fourth hostage, Levinson. Nelson met with Levinsonâs family and has  repeatedly   called  on Washington to urge Iran to release him. In 2017, Nelson led lawmakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio,Â whoÂ  sent a letter Â to White House officials asking them to ""maintain pressure on Iran to see that (Levinson) is returned as soon as possible."" This year, Nelson cosponsored the Iran Human Rights and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act ( S.2365 ) to impose sanctions against individuals involved in taking Americans hostage and violating the human rights of the Iranian citizens. Scott said that Nelson ""voted against requiring Iran to recognize Israel and release American hostages."" The attack is a misleading stretch. What really happened in 2015 was that Nelson voted no on a cloture motion. By voting no, Nelson voted toÂ continued debate on an amendment that experts said would have defeated the Iran deal. The amendment would have prohibited the president from waiving sanctions unless Iran released detained Americans and formally recognized Israel. But the deal was focused on the nuclear issue, not an attempt to solve major issues with Iran. Also, Nelson has worked to urge the White House to continue pressing for the release of aÂ U.S. hostage in Iran.

The Arizona Democratic Partyâs claim has some elements of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. McSally voted to repeal internet data rules that had not taken effect. Her vote was not ""to let"" companies sell data (they were already legally allowed to do that); it was to halt new rules requiring companies to seek usersâ explicit consent before doing so. Companies donât generally sell internet data, they rather sell access to users by allowing advertisers to target specific demographics, telecommunications experts told PolitiFact. McSally ""got paid $42,000"" by corporations allowed to sell usersâ personal information? The Arizona Democratic Party bases this claim on campaign contributions McSally received after the March 28 vote. Federal Election Commission data shows that political action committees for telecommunications companies and their employees donated about $42,000 to McSallyâs campaign or an affiliated political action committee. McSallyâs campaign spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair called the Arizona Democratic Partyâs claim ""absurd and offensive."" ""This rule favored organizations like Facebook. It gave them more access to data than other companies, and did nothing to protect Arizonans' information from them,"" Sinclair said. Congress, including McSally, in March 2017  voted  to get rid of internet privacy rules the Federal Communications Commission created during the Obama administration. They were scheduled to take effect December 2017 under the Trump administration. The rules  were intended to give consumers more control  over how internet service providers (ISPs), such as Verizon or Comcast, used their data. They required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history and other ""sensitive information,"" such as Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. (Facebook is not an ISP, so the new rules didnât apply to Facebook.) Arizonaâs Flake challenged the rules under the Congressional Review Act of 1996,  arguing that Obamaâs FCC went too far  and that internet privacy issues have been under the FTCâs purview, not the FCCâs. The vote removed the FCCâs authority to regulate the sale of consumer data, said Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings Institution. This part of Arizona Democratic Partyâs claim ignores several key facts. Before the vote, companies were already legally allowed to sell internet data, but were not doing so to begin with, experts said. ""The new privacy rules for broadband internet access service providers hadnât gone into effect so, practically speaking, data collection practices remained the same,"" said Brent Skorup, a senior research fellow in the Technology Policy Program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. The main issue involved  ""de-identified"" browsing data  (data that cannot reasonably be linked to a particular consumer, computer, or device) and whether it was considered sensitive when broadband internet access service providers had it, Skorup said. ""The Obama FTC in 2012 said no, de-identified browsing data isnât sensitive; the Obama FCC in 2016 said yes, it is sensitive,"" Skorup said. ""Congresswoman McSallyâs vote was, effectively, a vote to restore the Obama FTCâs privacy policies and halt the Obama FCCâs proposed policies."" Skorup emphasized that ISPs cannot and could not collect sensitive user data â such as health information, financial information, childrenâs information, Social Security numbers, and geolocation information â without express consumer consent. The vote caused Americans to lose whatever potential privacy rights they would have and shouldâve had, said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit advocating for consumers on digital privacy and consumer protection issues. Yet internet service providers arenât selling or giving usersâ data to advertisers, Chester said. They keep the data and use it to deliver targeted ads, he said. ""Itâs not about selling your data, itâs about selling access to you,"" Chester said. Information generally isnât sold by ISPs, but rather those seeking to advertise could go to ISPs with a demographic they are hoping to target, and ISPs could then use either aggregate or otherwise anonymized data to send advertisements to the right groups of people, said Doug Brake, director of telecom policy at Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank. ""The FTC has detailed guidelines on the types of consent that are necessary for different types of data, with more sensitive data requiring express opt-in consent. â¦ From what we know, ISP policies are all consistent with FTC guidelines, and they remained in place through the passing and repeal of the Obama-era FCC rules,"" Brake said. (Cox Communications and other internet providers, issued  statements  after the vote saying they do not sell personally identifiable information or web browsing history.) The Arizona Democratic Party based this claim on  contributions  made after the March vote to McSallyâs campaign by political action committees tied to telecommunications companies and their employees. ( Federal law  generally prohibits corporations from making contributions to candidates for federal offices.) The Arizona Democratic Party pointed to a March  National Journal article  citing data from the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance data at OpenSecrets.org. ""Over the course of her career, McSally has taken nearly $100,000 in campaign contributions from sources such as AT&T, Verizon, and Cox Communications, all of whom provide internet services,"" the article said. Specifically after the vote, Federal Election Commission filings show McSally received $37,000 in such contributions and that Comcast contributed an additional $5,000 to a  political action committee   affiliated with McSally , the National Journal reported. Contributors to McSally for Congress  since the March vote include Cox Enterprises PAC, Verizon Communications Inc. Political Action Committee, and Comcast Corporation & NBCUniversal Political Action Committee. The Arizona Democratic Party launched a website that claimed, ""Congresswoman Martha McSally voted to let companies sell your internet data to the highest bidder without your consent. Then she got paid $42,000 by the very corporations she allowed to sell your personal info."" McSallyâs vote did not allow companies to sell internet data â that was already legally allowed. Still, experts said companies generally donât sell data to third parties such as advertisers, rather use the data to deliver companiesâ ads. McSallyâs campaign received about $42,000 after the March vote from political action committees tied to telecommunications companies. McSally also received contributions from those groups prior to the vote. We rate Arizona Democratic Partyâs statement Mostly False.

"Says U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis ""voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants.""",A ridiculous attack on Ron DeSantis about food stamps and immigrants.,"Republican U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, who has received support from President Donald Trump in his bid for Florida governor, favors giving a benefit to immigrants in the country illegally, says an article on Facebook. ""DeSantis voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants,"" stated a March 23 headline on  Uncle Samâs Misguided Children , a website that says it is a ""community founded by United States Marine Veterans to bring awareness of the lame stream media."" The article drew from the  Central Florida Post , a right-leaning website. The Uncle Sam story said that DeSantisâ vote on the 2014 farm bill ""ultimately puts illegal aliens and criminals ahead of law-abiding American citizens in line for food stamps â a judgment President Trump would surely question."" (While  Trump has said  the ""time has come"" to restrict federal assistance to immigrants, that already exists.) We found that the Uncle Sam article omitted key context that immigrants in the country illegally were already banned from getting food stamps long before the 2014 farm bill, a sweeping package that only briefly mentions verifying immigration status. The article also ignored an explanation by DeSantis about why he voted against the farm bill. DeSantis  is running in the  August primary  against a field that includes  Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam . A  farm bill  is passed about every five years, reauthorizing food and agriculture policy including measures such as crop and commodity subsidies, conservation programs, agriculture research and food stamps, known as SNAP for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Uncle Sam story points to an  article  about DeSantisâ 2014 vote as one of 63 Republicans to join 103 Democrats voting against HR 2642, the farm bill. The legislation, which passed  the House 251-166  and was signed into law by  President Barack Obama , had drawn opposition from both sides: Some liberals said the cuts were too steep while some conservatives said it didnât do enough to cut spending. While the  legislation  was hundreds of pages, only a few sentences related to illegal immigrants. Section 4015 stated ""a state agency shall be required to use an immigration status verification system."" That provision drew scant media attention. Some news stories mentioned in a single sentence that the farm bill banned illegal immigrants, college students, lottery winners and dead people from getting food stamps. Another reason the immigration section may not have been a key part of the debate? Federal law already generally banned immigrants in the country illegally from getting food stamps. The  Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996  restricted access for immigrants to get food stamps. But subsequent legislation restored access for certain immigrants, including refugees and lawful permanent residents with a proven work history. While the 2014 farm bill required states to use an immigration status verification system,  most states already had procedures  in place to meet that requirement. Nune Phillips, a policy analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy, which advocates on behalf of low-income people, said the farm bill didnât change  immigrant eligibility rules  for food and nutrition assistance. ""Undocumented immigrants are not currently, and never have been, eligible for SNAP. To qualify for SNAP, applicants must be U.S. citizens or be eligible, lawfully-present noncitizens,"" he said. The section on immigration wasnât the motivation behind DeSantisâ vote against the farm bill. He voted against the bill because of the  high costs . He believed that the bill failed to overhaul a food stamp program that was growing too large, said campaign spokesman Brad Herold. In a  2014 Facebook post , DeSantis said the farm bill was a ""bad deal for taxpayers and contains little in the way of meaningful reforms,"" such as work requirements. Herold said DeSantis does not believe in granting any form of benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. He has votedÂ in favor of amendments related to  work requirements  for  food stamps . But the 2014 farm bill didnât alter the pre-existing policy that illegal benefits are not eligible for SNAP benefits. ""Voting against a bill that expanded farm subsidies and failed to enact welfare reforms is not a vote to confer benefits on illegal immigrants,"" Herold said. Jacob Engels, publisher of the Central Florida Post and author of the article inked from the Uncle Sam website, directed PolitiFact to an article by the  Center for Immigration Studies , an organization that advocates for low levels of immigration. The story was more nuanced, saying that a family that has some citizens and some immigrants in the country illegally could still get some benefits. Uncle Samâs Misguided Children said that DeSantis ""voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants."" The article fails to point out that even before the farm bill passed, undocumented immigrants were already generally blocked from getting food stamps. The farm bill that DeSantis voted against was a sweeping piece of legislation that mentions immigrants only briefly in the context of requiring states to verify their status. DeSantis stated at the time of his vote against the bill that he thought it was a bad deal for taxpayers and failed to rein in the food stamp program. By voting ""no"" he took a stand against the overall piece of legislation â thatâs not evidence that he ""voted in favor of food stamps for illegal immigrants.""

"""In the Senate, (Mike) DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses.""",Ohio TV ad misleads in attack on Mike DeWine about immigration.,"A TV ad portrays Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican candidate for governor, as out of step with President Donald Trump on immigration. Onward Ohio , a political action committee, launched a  statewide TV ad  on March 20. ""If you like President Trump then you wonât like Mike DeWine,"" states the narrator. ""In the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses."" DeWineâs May 8 primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, is a former chair of the PAC and  echoed the attack on Twitter . The ad attacks DeWineâs position on other topics including his grade from the NRA, which we have  previously fact-checked . We found that the ad doesnât accurately explain DeWineâs Senate vote related to Social Security and requires some context to explain why as Attorney General he concluded that  some  undocumented immigrants should receive driverâs licenses. We emailed Onward Ohio and did not get a reply. The ad makes it sound as if DeWine wanted to provide a new entitlement for undocumented immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security -- an attack we have seen before against  Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark ., and  Harry Reid, D-Nev . In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former undocumented immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill that included border security, a new temporary worker visa and a path to legal status. At the time, undocumented immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. During a Senate debate over the broader bill, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an  amendment  to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number. On May 18, 2006,  the Senate voted  50-49 to table the amendment, effectively killing it. DeWine and Clinton, then a New York senator, were among those who voted in favor of tabling it. DeWineâs campaign spokesman Ryan Stubenrauch said that DeWine ""voted to table the amendment because he believed that people should keep what they had earned if they could meet the steep requirements to become legal residents."" DeWine had expressed support for the overall bill because it included border security and also addressed the 12 million undocumented immigrants. ""It's a dangerous thing to have them in the underground. We have to put some paper on them and document them,"" he said several weeks before the bill passed. The House passed its own version, and the two chambers didnât work out a compromise, so the bills died. This part of the ad could leave viewers with the misleading impression that DeWine took actions to allow all undocumented immigrants to get driversâ licenses. DeWineâs recommendation while he was Ohio attorney general pertained only to a narrow slice of immigrants. In 2013, Ohio lacked a uniform policy regarding whether to grant driverâs licenses to immigrants who had temporary status through the 2012 program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which began under President Barack Obama. Some state officials issued driverâs licenses, while others refused. On March 29, 2013, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles  announced  that Ohio would allow the issuance of temporary licenses to qualified participants in DACA. The bureau reached a decision after reviewing guidance by DeWine ""that DACA grantees are eligible for temporary driver licenses under Ohio law."" DeWine wrote in a March 19  letter  to the Ohio Latino Affairs Commission that DACA recipients could get a Social Security number and work permit. ""With these documents and any other documents normally required by the BMV, an individual can provide the BMV with the information necessary to receive a driverâs license,"" he wrote. ""I encourage any citizen who is concerned about the law or policy to contact their legislators and voice that concern. As Attorney General, I do not have the authority to introduce or vote on legislation."" DeWineâs campaign said he didnât issue a formal advisory opinion -- he only expressed his view in a letter, and then it was up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to issue driverâs licenses. The TV ad cites a  Cleveland Plain Dealer Â  article that mentioned DeWineâs conclusion. David Leopold, an immigration lawyer at Ulmer & Berne in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, worked in an advocacy capacity closely with Jose Mendez, a DACA recipient who pushed the issue at the time in Ohio. Â  Leopold told PolitiFact that it wasnât a case of DeWine allowing undocumented immigrants to receive driverâs licenses. He was simply interpreting the DACA policy under Ohio law. Since DACA holders were considered ""lawfully present,""Â they were able to provide the necessary information to apply for a driverâs license. There were around 1,900 immigrants with DACA status in Ohio by the end of May 2013 when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service first started tracking state data. Overall, there were  95,000 undocumented immigrants  in Ohio. As of 2013, the  majority of states  already gave driverâs licenses to DACA recipients. Two states, Arizona and Nebraska, implemented policies that excluded DACA grantees from driverâs license eligibility, but as a result of litigation or legislative action, both states later issued driverâs licenses, according to the  National Immigration Law Center . Trump announced in 2017 he would  rescind DACA . While aÂ federal judge ordered his administration to continue renewals they are not required to process newÂ applications. The  U.S. Supreme Court  declined to take it up andÂ Congress hasnât been able to reach any agreement on DACA. Onward Ohio said in a TV ad that ""in the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses."" On both of these attacks, the ad makes a sweeping statement without filling in viewers about the scope of what a bill and a policy actually said. The Social Security provision was more narrow than the ad suggests, because it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by people who at one time had been undocumented immigrants. While attorney general, DeWine concluded that undocumented immigrants who had temporary status through the federal DACA program were entitled to driverâs licenses, but that didnât apply to all undocumented immigrants. There are kernels of truth here, but the ad fails to provide a complete picture of DeWineâs actions.

"""Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban.""",Heidi Heitkamp didn't high-five Chuck Schumer following abortion vote.,"A  headline  on a North Dakota political blog wrongly said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., high-fived Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., following a controversial abortion vote. ""Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban,"" the headline reads. The  vote  in question was to proceed to a motion that would make nearly all abortions after 20 weeks illegal and subject anyone who performed the procedure to prison time or fines. The 51-46 yea-to-nay vote fell below the filibuster threshold of 60 votes, and Heitkampâs vote was one of those nays. But did Heitkamp follow up her vote with a celebratory high-five with the Senate minority leader? The main image, a screen grab from C-SPAN, certainly makes it seem that way. But the video, which is embedded in the story, shows more of an awkward greeting than a crude celebration. The footage shows Heitkamp walking into the chamber as she converses with Cory Booker, D-N.J.. She responds to the clerkâs roll call in the negative, and resumes chatting. As they speak, Schumer approaches Booker and Heitkamp, and Heitkamp catches his eye. They each wave hello with their hands up, and Heitkamp reaches her hand out to meet Schumerâs as he lands at their side. They clasp hands, exchange a few inaudible words, and let go as Booker pats Schumerâs shoulder. The vote was about halfway through, so the hand clasp was not in reaction to a final tally. Typical high fives involve  slapping  of two hands in celebration. This was a very gradual meeting of awkwardly waving hands. ""They were greeting each other to say hello, as senators often do during votes,"" said Abigail McDonough, Heitkampâs communications director. Justin Goodman, Schumerâs press secretary, confirmed the senators did not speak about the vote when they greeted each other. The vote was held on a Monday night, so it was the first time a lot of the senators would have seen each other since the previous week. Rob Port, the editor of the blog, did not provide any evidence that the hand-gesture was about the vote. ""Looked like a high five to me, but the video speaks for itself I think,"" Port said. The clip was generated by a C-SPAN user, who titled it ""Heitkamp & Schumer High-Five Over Abortion Vote."" Tom Campbell, Heitkampâs Republican challenger, posted the clip to his Facebook page three hours before the SayAnythingBlog post was published. A SayAnythingBlog.com headline said, ""Heitkamp High-Fives Schumer After Voting Against 20-Week Abortion Ban."" The headline suggests the celebration of a pro-abortion victory, but thatâs not what the footage shows. The video shows an awkward hand waving-turned-holding between Schumer and Heitkamp on a Monday night. Both senators said they did not mention the vote on the floor, and that they were simply greeting each other. Port provided no evidence that the two were celebrating the vote.

"""In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling.""",Was Ron DeSantis the 'deciding' vote against the state's right to protect Florida's coast?,"Democratic gubernatorial candidate Gwen Graham called out her newest Republican opponent Ron DeSantis for going to bat for oil drilling off Floridaâs coast. Her Jan. 4 tweet came as the White House prepared to announce a new offshore drilling plan that originally included Florida among states that would see expanded drilling. (The White House later walked it back to exempt Florida at the  urging of Gov. Rick Scott .) When DeSantis had the opportunity to keep drilling out of Florida, Graham said, he went against it. ""In Congress, @RonDeSantisFL was the DECIDING vote AGAINST our state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling,"" Graham tweeted. ""Will Congressman DeSantis stand up for Florida or is he too scared of losing @realDoanldTramp's endorsement?"" The tweet included a link to a close vote on a 2013  amendment  to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act ( HR 2231 ), which never became law. Was DeSantis, whose district includes several east coast beaches, really ""the deciding vote"" on an effort to keep drilling out of the state? The short answer: Itâs hard to say there is ever such a thing as ""the deciding vote"" with close calls in Congress.Â  DeSantisâ specific position on drilling is squishy. Most recently, DeSantisÂ  embraced Â Scott's opposition to Trump's plan. ""In Florida our coastline is so important to our economy, itâs important to property values, itâs important to tourism,"" DeSantis said on  Fox & Friends .Â ""And we need to protect our coastline."" Other actions speak to support for the coast, including a December 2015  letter  to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management against seismic airgun exploration and a  letter  in opposition to the 2017 Interior Department executive order that advanced offshore oil and gas exploration in the Atlantic Ocean. Â  Thereâs also his vote in favor of a failed  amendment  that would have banned seismic testing in areas bordering Florida. He was one of 24 Republicans to vote for the testing ban. He alsoÂ voted for a GrahamÂ  amendement  that would have restricted funds being used for the research, investigation, or study of offshore drilling.Â  But that's not to say that DeSantis has always voted against drilling.Â  The 210-209 vote in Graham's tweet happened years earlier. In the summer of 2013, then-U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, proposed an  amendment  to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act pushed by House Republicans. The larger bill aimed to expand U.S. offshore energy production by directing the U.S. Interior Department secretary to implement a five-year oil and gas leasing program off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Graysonâs amendment would have ensured the ability of Florida or any state to prohibit the use of drilling within its boundaries. At the time, Grayson said the amendment would have avoided the possibility of the federal government overriding states' rights to decide. When it came to a vote, Graysonâs amendment failed by one vote, and DeSantis voted against the amendment. The larger bill passed the House but did move past the Democratic-controlled Senate. Does that mean he was the ""deciding vote?"" Thereâs no doubt that DeSantisâ vote was crucial. But as we  have concluded  in fact-checks of similar attacks, the ""deciding vote"" label could just as easily be applied to any other lawmaker who voted on his side â making the term a bit meaningless. (Many Democrats were attacked as being the deciding vote on the  narrowly passed  Affordable Care Act, for example.) Thatâs the general rule. We wondered if DeSantis did anything to justify being singled out, such as holding his support until the last moment. We couldnât spot from  C-SPAN footage  whether DeSantis was one of the members who changed his mind at the literal last minute. Even if he were, however, he would not have been the only lawmaker to do so. Graham spokesman Matt Harringer argued it is noteworthy that DeSantis was in the  minority of Florida Republicans  who voted against this amendment. Seven Florida Republicans, including DeSantis, voted against the amendment, while nine Republicans voted for the amendment. DeSantisâ team didnât argue his vote, but they did take issue with Grahamâs framing of the measure as a vote ""against our stateâs right to protect Florida waters from drilling."" Many Republicans didnât see it that way, arguing Graysonâs measure would not have actually changed Floridaâs control of its coast. ""Since the underlying bill did nothing to alter the existing relationship between the federal and state governments, the amendment itself contained no substantive policy that would have changed the ability of Florida to prevent development of waters within its jurisdiction,"" said DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick. Fusick said the balance of power between the federal and state government was already determined by the Submerged Lands Act (which sets federal government ownership of submerged lands after the first three miles from the stateâs coast) and the  Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act  (which also applies to land beyond three miles offshore), which were both enacted in 1953. Holly Parker, the Florida regional manager for the Surfrider Foundation, said that if Graysonâs amendment only applied to state waters, then it would seem to be a duplication of an existing right. However, she said itâs possible that the broader failed legislation would have changed that. Â  ""Now, if the underlying legislation somehow impeded those state rights and this amendment was an attempt to clarify or delineate the rights of a state to regulate those submerged (lands), that would be different,"" Parker said. Athan Manuel, the director of the Sierra Clubâs Landâs Protection Program, said he thinks it's possible that the bill could have changed the separation of powers. Regardless, he said, the point of Graysonâs amendment was to be ""extra clear"" that Florida had a say in what happened. ""Maybe it wasnât as necessary, but it's important to send the right message,"" Manuel said. ""If he wanted to vote against drilling, he should have voted for the Grayson amendment."" Graham said DeSantis casted the ""deciding vote against"" the state's right to protect Florida waters from drilling. Thereâs no question that DeSantisâ vote on an amendment to the Offshore Energy and Jobs Act was crucial, but saying DeSantis was the deciding vote goes too far. Technically, any of the 209 other people who voted against the bill could be considered the ""deciding vote."" Furthermore, the significance of Graysonâs amendment is a subject of debate. Democrats saw it as securing Floridaâs right to protect Florida waters, whereas Republicans say the amendment wouldnât have changed the powers of the state.

"Democratic lawmakers who voted in favor of short-term spending bills ""just voted to deport Dreamers.""",Did Democrats vote to deport Dreamers?,"A progressive advocacy group claims Democratic lawmakers have voted to deport so-called ""Dreamers,"" young immigrants in the country illegally. ""Democrats who just voted to deport Dreamers. Share to shame Democrats who are enabling Trumpâs racism,"" said an image  tweeted  Dec. 21 by Credo Mobile, listing the names of 14 Democratic representatives, 17 Democratic senators and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. Remember these names. Shame.  #DreamActNow   #DeportationCaucus   @SenateDems   @HouseDemocrats   @NancyPelosi   @SenSchumer   pic.twitter.com/za5l2v1jFQ The accusation is jarring after years of congressional Democrats pushing for legislation granting certain immigrants a chance to stay in the United States legally and have a pathway to U.S. citizenship. Contrary to their rhetoric, did dozens actually vote to kick them out of the country? Credoâs tweet came after members of the U.S. House and Senate, including Democrats, voted to continue funding the government short-term, until Jan. 19. The final bill that President Donald Trump signed into  public law  contained no reference to deportations or Dreamers. But immigrant advocates had urged Democrats to vote against the spending bills if they did not include a legislative solution for Dreamers who are at risk of deportation. Credoâs rationale is voting for a bill that doesnât benefit Dreamers amounts to voting to deport them. Thatâs a mischaracterization of the actual content of the bill. The Trump administration in September rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program created during the Obama administration to prevent the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally who came to the United States as children. This group is often referred to as Dreamers. The government has granted DACA to about 800,000 people, and  around 690,000  are currently protected. Despite rescinding DACA, Trumpâs administration allowed DACA beneficiaries with permits expiring by March 5, 2018, (about 154,000 people) to apply for renewal in the fall. The vast majority of the 154,000 recipients were granted renewals or have an application pending, but about 21,000 donât have a renewal pending, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Immigrants who chose not to submit renewal applications may be at risk of deportation based on that decision. (DHS acting spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton  tweeted  that not all DACA recipients choose to renew, so it does not necessarily mean that immigration officials denied the requests.) DACA recipients with permits expiring after March 5 are set to lose their deportation relief if Congress does not pass a bill to help them out. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., as well as other Democratic senators seeking re-election in 2018,Â support Dreamers but were not ready to shut down the government in December over the issue. ""I will exercise every bit of leverage I can for the Dream Act, but if there is a vote that would lead to a shutdown, thatâs where I draw the line,""  Kaine  told the  Washington Post . On Dec. 21, lawmakers in the House and Senate approved short-term spending bills in order  to prevent a government shutdown . The bill Trump signed into law did not have any provisions related to Dreamers, either to protect or deport them. Since Democrats didnât force passage of the Dream Act, a bill to benefit Dreamers, some immigrants protected by DACA will be subject to deportation, Credo campaign manager Nicole Regalado told PolitiFact. ""We believe it is more than reasonable to assert that any Democrat who voted for Decemberâs CR without any protections for DACA recipients voted to help Trump deport immigrant young people whose DACA status will expire in the coming weeks,"" Regalado said. However, itâs uncertain that lawmakers could have passed the Dream Act. Trump has  said  he expects ""massive border security"" in exchange for a solution for Dreamers, and Democrats have voiced strong opposition to his border wall, among other measures. The Trump administration has emphasized that any immigrant in the country illegally is subject to deportation, though Kirstjen Nielsen, in November during her Senate confirmation hearing for Secretary of Homeland Security, said DACA recipients whose protection expired would not be an enforcement priority. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the conversation would continue ""because it is an emergency."" ""They kicked the can for the omnibus into January. Itâs this year, extended, thatâs what it is. Itâs the process,"" Pelosi told reporters,Â  The Hill reported . Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., a prominent immigrant advocate, tweeted that Democrats would continue fighting for Dreamers in 2018.

Credo tweeted that Democratic lawmakers who voted in favor of short-term spending bills in December ""just voted to deport Dreamers."" Lawmakers voted to continue funding the government until Jan. 19, but there was no language in the legislation to deport Dreamers. Credo contends that voting for a bill that does not include protection for Dreamers is essentially a vote to deport them. Thatâs an interpretation of the vote, but not an accurate representation of the content of the bill that was voted on.

"""Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes.""",Koch-backed group is Half True in claiming Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes.,"It seems  Charles  and David Koch, the conservative billionaire industrialists, want to make U.S. Sen.  Tammy Baldwin  the $5 trillion woman. At least, thatâs the aim of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the political and policy  network  thatâs tied to the two brothers. On Oct. 26, 2017, a year out from the 2018 election, Freedom Partners attacked Baldwin  with two TV ads . Using both a narrator and words on the screen, the two ads make this claim about the Wisconsin Democrat: ""Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes."" The claim gives no context, leaving it to the viewer to wonder whether her vote was for a one-year $5 trillion tax hike. So, letâs investigate. The group Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, also known simply as Freedom Partners, is  a group  based outside of Washington, D.C.. It says it will  spend $1.6 million  on the two TV ads, as well as digital versions. Baldwin is up for re-election to a second term in the November 2018 election. So far, two Republicans -- political newcomer  Kevin Nicholson  and  Leah Vukmir , a state senator -- have launched campaigns to be the GOP nominee. In the 2016 Wisconsin Senate race, an affiliated group,  Freedom Partners Action Fund , said it spent $2 million  on a TV ad  attacking Democrat  Russ Feingold  over veterans care. Feingold lost to incumbent Republican  Ron Johnson , who won a second term. Now to the new ads. Baldwinâs vote The ads include a footnote making it clear that the $5 trillion claim is based on  Baldwinâs vote , in April 2011, for a fiscal 2012 federal budget proposed by the Congressional Progressive Caucus. At the time, Baldwin was representing the Madison area in the House and was a vice-chair of the caucus. The caucusÂ  says it Â ""seeks to give voice to the needs and aspirations of all Americans and to build a more just and humane society."" The caucusâ  proposed budget  was an alternative to federal budgets proposed by President  Barack Obama  and House Budget Committee chairman  Paul Ryan  of Wisconsin, the current House speaker. It was introduced as an amendment to Ryanâs budget and failed in the House, 347-77. The caucusâ budget called for  $3.9 trillion  in actual tax increases over the  next decade , such as raising income tax rates on millionaires and raising rates on the estate tax. However, it could also be argued that other measures in the budget, such as  allowing tax cuts  adopted under President  George W. Bush  to expire, also were tax increases. The budget also outlined $1.7 trillion in spending cuts,  largely  from  defense , as well as $1.7 trillion in ""public investments"" in areas such as education, transportation and infrastructure. An important point here: As we have stated in past  fact   checks , voting for something as massive as a federal budget and its countless provisions doesnât mean a lawmaker supports every provision. Lawmakers who voted for the caucus budget might have been motivated, for example, by its defense cuts or new spending, rather than any or all of the tax increases. At the same time, the amount of revenue to be  collected in taxes  is a  major feature  of any budget, as it helps set spending parameters. The ads The ads include a footnote that cites a PolitiFact Wisconsin  fact check . It rated a different claim -- that Baldwin voted for a budget that included ""trillions more"" in spending than the Obama budget. That fact check said that, according to experts, the caucus budget would have raised taxes by some $5 trillion more than Obamaâs budget. We have since clarified that reference to make it consistent with an  earlier fact check . In that earlier item, experts had told us that total tax  collections  in the caucus budget would be $5 trillion higher than in the Obama budget. Tax collections can rise for any number of reasons -- from tax increases, yes, but also factors such as growth in the economy. Our rating Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce says: ""Tammy Baldwin voted for $5 trillion in higher taxes."" Baldwin voted for a 2012 federal budget that would have raised taxes by $3.9 trillion over 10 years, but it also would have made $1.7 trillion in spending cuts and spent $1.7 trillion in areas such as infrastructure. Voting for the budget didnât mean that Baldwin necessarily supported all of the tax increases. There were estimates that total tax collections -- another possible measure of ""higher taxes,"" as stated in the ad -- under budget Baldwin voted for would have been $5 trillion higher than under the budget proposed by the Obama administration. But the ad didnât make clear that that amount was over a 10-year span, not a sudden increase. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.",11/1/17,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/nov/01/freedom-partners/koch-backed-group-half-true-claiming-tammy-baldwin/,1,,
"SaysÂ Stacey Evans ""voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning.""",School voucher claim in Ga. gov. race leaves out important details.,"As public school advocates, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial frontrunners Stacey Abrams and Stacey Evans haveÂ both taken a firm stance against privatized public education and especially  school vouchers . But at a  recent forum  featuring the two candidates, Abrams accused Evans of voting for vouchers when she was a state representative. ""You voted for vouchers. You didnât vote for it the last two times, but you voted for it in the beginning,"" Abrams said on Oct. 2. Abrams later said she was referring to Evansâ involvement with a bill about the  Georgia Student Scholarship Organization . The program began in 2008, three years  before Evans  held a seat in Georgiaâs General Assembly. Back then, the  Student Scholarship Organization bill  established a program that allows independent individuals and businesses to receive tax credits if they make donations to local private schools. The money is then used to fund scholarships that are given to qualified, low-income students to attend the private institutions. Abrams claims that Evans had voted in favor of school vouchers a few years later, when the Legislature made revisions to the program. Evans did  vote for an early version  of the 2011 bill, but not for the final version. According to her campaign, she only voted for the measure because it had  provisions  that improved the programâs transparency. When the final bill hit the House floor with its final revisions, the transparency clauses were removed, so  Evans voted against the bill. Evans has also maintained that she has never voted for vouchers because the Student Scholarship Organization is not a voucher program. On June 26, 2017, theÂ  Georgia Supreme Court ruled Â that stated that the scholarship program is not a voucher program, because it is financed by private individuals, not public revenue, a fact that Abrams had acknowledged during the debate. Despite the Supreme Court ruling, the Student Scholarship Organizationâs status as a voucher program is still subject to debate. Before the forum, the Evans campaign had already been defending her stance against vouchers, and on Oct. 12 the Abrams campaign  shared its opinion on Facebook Â that the funds in the program are ""vouchers by another name."" Our ruling Abrams said Evans ""voted for (school) vouchers...in the beginning."" Abrams said she was referring to the Student Scholarship Organization program. Some aspects of Abramsâ statement are wrong. Evans wasnât in the legislature in 2008 when program was approved. In 2011, Evans voted for revisions to the program, although she voted against the final version after those revisions were dropped. Over the years, thereâs been a legal dispute over whether the tax credits that fund the Student Scholarship Organization make the program different from school vouchers. In June 2017 Georgiaâs Supreme Court ruled that the ""voucher"" label did not apply. Abrams'Â claim had some accurate points, but it left out important details. We rate it Half True.",10/17/17,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/oct/17/stacey-abrams/school-voucher-claim-ga-gov-race-leaves-out-import/,1,,
"Says Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton ""all voted for"" a border wall as senators.",Jeff Denhamâs Half True claim top Democrats voted for border wall.,"On the day the Trump administration announced it will  end the so-called Dreamer program  in six months, California Congressman  Jeff Denham  floated the idea for a bill that could further secure the border and protect undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. ""This is certainly an opportunity to combine a Dreamer Act with border security,"" Denham, a Republican who represents the Modesto area,  told NPR  on Sept. 5, 2017. ""This is something that should have bipartisan support. The presidentâs already asking for border security, why wouldnât we add a Dreamer aspect to that as well?"" The administrationâs action affects about 800,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Roughly a quarter of these âDreamersâ live in California. The Obama-era program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has allowed them to continue to live and work in the U.S. temporarily, following a vetting process. President Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to DACA before the administration formally ends it. In his interview with Rachael Martin of NPR, Denham went on to claim that a DACA/border bill shouldnât be controversial because top Democrats have supported border security, and specifically a border wall, in years past. MARTIN: ""When you say border security, youâre talking about the wall? What do you mean by that?"" DENHAM: ""Yes, yes. Which was bipartisan back when (then) Sen. Obama, Sen. Schumer and (then) Sen. Clinton all voted for it. This used to be a very bipartisan thing before President Trump announced it. I think it can be bipartisan once again."" Denham is citing votes by the Democrats in 2006 on an act that authorized a fence. Itâs a claim that takes things out of context and was  repeated multiple times by Donald Trump  during his campaign for president and was made in April by White House budget director  Mick Mulvaney . After he spoke with NPR, Denham repeated the idea of a combined border security and DACA bill in an  interview on Capital Public Radio . In that interview, he called border security a bipartisan idea but did not directly call Trumpâs wall bipartisan or reveal whether he favors that specific proposal. As PolitiFact has noted  several   times   in the past , the fence voted on in 2006 was less ambitious than the âbig, beautiful wallâ Trump has pitched over the past two years and promised Mexico would pay for. Hereâs PolitiFactâs analysis of this topic: The Secure Fence Act of 2006 The  Secure Fence Act of 2006 , which was passed by a Republican Congress and signed by President George W. Bush, authorized about 700 miles of fencing along certain stretches of land between the border of the United States and Mexico. The act also authorized the use of more vehicle barriers, checkpoints and lighting to curb illegal immigration, and the use of advanced technology such as satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles. At the time the act was being considered, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer were all members of the Senate. (Schumer of New York is now the Senate minority leader.) Obama, Clinton, Schumer and 23 other Democratic senators voted in favor of the act when it passed in the Senate by a vote of 80 to 19. Originally, the act called on the Department of Homeland Security to install at least two layers of reinforced fencing along some stretches of the border. That was amended later, however, through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008, which got rid of the double-layer requirement. Currently, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas.Â (AP Photo/Eric Gay) So how does that compare to Trumpâs wall? Trump plans for the wall areÂ  vague , but hereâs what we know. He said the wall doesnât need to run the nearly 2,000 miles of the border, but about 1,000 miles because of natural barriers. He said it could cost between $8 billion and $12 billion, be made of precast concrete, and rise 35 to 40 feet, or 50 feet, or higher. Cost estimates by others, including  this one cited by Sen. Kamala Harris , D-Calif., vary widely. Experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the differences in semantics between a wall and a fence are not too significant because both block people. Still, there are obvious differences between the fence and Trumpâs wall proposal. A 2016  Associated Press  report from the border described ""rust-colored thick bars"" that form ""teeth-like slats"" 18 feet high. ""There are miles of gaps between segments and openings in the fence itself,"" the report said. Trump criticized the 2006 fence as too modest during the 2016 campaign. ""Now we got lucky because it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall, no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad,"" Trump said. (Actually, the project didnât face environmental hurdles; we rated that part of the claim  Mostly False .) Itâs also worth noting that the political context surrounding the 2006 vote was different, too. Democrats normally in favor of looser immigration laws saw the Secure Fence Act of 2006 as the lesser of two evils, according to a  Boston Globe  report that detailed the legislative process. Ever since Trump proposed his wall during the presidential campaign, Democrats have called it overkill and too expensive. Meanwhile, PolitiFact California asked Denhamâs spokeswoman for evidence to support the claim. She pointed to the votes by Obama, Clinton and Schumer in 2006. This isnât the first time Denham has made a puzzling claim about âbipartisanâ efforts in Congress. In May,  he told town hall attendees  that the process that led to the GOP health care bill, passed exclusively by House Republicans, was ""bipartisan."" We found it was a poor choice of words given how little cooperation there was over the bill. Experts told us it applied only in the most bare bones sense that both Republicans and Democrats had a chance to read and scrutinize the bill in committees. Our ruling Denham recently claimed that Obama, Schumer and Clinton voted for a border wall in 2006. They did vote for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. Still, the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself called the 2006 fence a ""nothing wall."" PolitiFact has rated several similar claims Half True, noting they are partially accurate but ignore important context. Denhamâs claim also gets it about half right, but leaves out key information.

"U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies ""charge five times more for people over 50.""","GOP health care bill charges five times more for people over 50, liberal group says.","A group fighting against the Affordable Care Act repeal says that House Republicans voted for a health care bill that would lead to skyrocketing costs for older consumers. Save My Care , a health care advocacy group, launched an ad attacking two dozen GOP House members who voted for the American Health Care Act including  U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo  of Miami. Â  ""Congressman Curbelo just voted for a disastrous health care repeal bill opposed by the American Medical Association, AARP and the American Cancer Society. Curbelo voted to raise your costs and cut coverage for millions, to let insurance companies deny affordable coverage for cancer treatment and maternity care, and charge five times more for people over 50. Curbelo voted yes even though the bill makes coverage completely unaffordable to people with pre-existing conditions,"" the  ad  claims. The same ad also attacks U.S. Rep. Brian Mast who represents Floridaâs Treasure Coast and members in  many other states , including moderates who could face tough re-election campaigns in 2018. The ad is largely digital but in some districts it will appear on TV. Formed in 2016, Save My Care is affiliated withÂ  Eric Kessler,  a former White House appointee, helping to manage conservation issues during Bill Clintonâs administration. It operates out of the same office as the  New Venture Fund , a 501(c)(3) that launches projects related to global health and other areas. There were a lot of claims to check out from the ad, but we wanted to know whether the bill allows insurance companies to ""charge five times more for people over 50."" One provision jumped out right away: Insurance companies could charge five times more for those ages 50-64 buying insurance on the individual market. Some viewers might assume the five-fold increase starts from zero. What the ad doesnât tell you is that insurers can already charge older people more than younger adults â three times as much. Age ainât nothing but a number (but it couldÂ make insurance more expensive) For this fact-check, weâre looking at what the proposed House health bill does about older adults between ages 50-64 on the individual health insurance market. So this doesnât apply to seniors on  Medicare , or people between 50 and 64 years old who have employer-sponsored coverage. Under current law, insurance companies can charge older adults up to three times as much as younger people based on their age. This is known as 3-to-1 ""rate banding."" The House  bill  increases the ratio up to five times starting in 2018, unless states set a different age ratio. Before the Affordable Care Act, premiums for older adults were typically four or five timesÂ the premiums charged to younger adults, according to the  Kaiser Family Foundation . That more accurately reflects the actual higher costs spent for older adultsâ health care, said Linda Blumberg, health policy expert at the Urban Institute. So the lower 3-to-1 age ratio in the ACA was a better deal for older adults. The goal was to make coverage more affordable for older adults regardless of their health status. If the House bill with the 5-to-1 rate banding were to become law, older adults would pay more than current law, according to an estimate by the  Rand Corporation , which evaluated an earlier version of the American Health Care Act, or AHCA. Â (The research was funded by the Commonwealth Fund, which aims to increase health care access for the poor.) The increased costs would occur, Rand Corporation said, as a result of tax credits in the House bill not increasing with age as steeply as premiums. Young people, however, would get a break on premiums. Older Americans could get hit with other costs, too The change in age ratios is just one of many provisions of the House proposal that could change the costs for older adults. The legislation would replace the current income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. For adults over 60, that would mean a $4,000 credit. For adults under 30, the credit would be $2,000. The legislation phases out tax credits for individuals who make more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who files jointly earning $150,000). Kaiser created an  interactive map  to show that the cost impact varies based on several factors. ""Generally, people who are older, lower-income or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA,"" Kaiser concluded about the House bill. A  Congressional Budget Office analysis  of an earlier version of the legislation (the final legislation did not receive a CBO score) concluded that it would disproportionately increase the number of uninsured ages 50-64 with incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty limit. For an example: Under current law, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 would pay a net premium of $1,700 after factoring in a tax credit. Under the House bill, according to CBO, that personâs premium rises to $14,600. (See table 4) Older Americans could see more changes if states choose to redefine  essential health benefits  for coverage in the individual market. ""I cannot imagine a scenario where the AHCA is not worse for older adults than the ACA,"" Blumberg said. Curbeloâs spokeswoman told us Curbelo has  called for improving  the bill that he voted for. ""The congressman is continuing to work to ensure that all Americans have access to coverage options they can afford, focusing specifically on making sure we increase the amount of the tax credits for lower income Americans and for those nearing the age of retirement,"" Joanna Rodriguez told PolitiFact. Our ruling The Save My Care ad says that Curbelo voted for a health care bill that will let insurance companies ""charge five times more for people over 50."" The ad refers to a provision that will allow insurance companies to charge adults five times more for insurance than younger people buying on the individual market. But the ad could leave a misleading impression that itâs five times more than the current situation -- and thatâs not the case. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were allowed to charge this age group three times as much for insurance (which was considered a better deal than the situation before). Also, the increase in the ratio applies to Americans ages 50-64 -- not seniors who are on Medicare.

Clinton voted for it.""",Fact-check: Did top Democrats vote for a border wall in 2006?,"White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said he doesnât understand Democratic opposition to funding the border wall because top Democrats voted for it just over 10 years ago. During an April 23 segment on  Fox News Sunday , Mulvaney talked down concerns about a government shutdown, but scolded Democrats for obstructing action on Trumpâs border wall. Mulvaney pointed to the voting record of top Democrats in 2006 to explain his confusion. ""We want our priorities funded and one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security, keeping Americans safe, and part of that was a border wall,"" he said. ""We still donât understand why the Democrats are so wholeheartedly against it. They voted for it in 2006. Then-Sen. Obama voted for it. Sen. Schumer voted for it. Sen. Clinton voted for it.

"""215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers.""","Congress let Internet providers 'spy on' your underwear purchases, advocacy group says.","Your Internet service provider has intimate knowledge about your intimates, and a bill headed to President Donald Trumpâs desk allows them to sell that information, says Internet privacy advocacy group Fight for the Future. Voting along party lines, Republicans in  Congress recently passed a joint resolution  that reverses a landmark Federal Communications Commission rule requiring Internet service providers (ISPs), like Comcast or Verizon, to ask customers for their explicit permission before handing user data over to advertisers and other third parties. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it into law. ""215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers,"" Fight for the Future  tweeted March 28 , after the bill passed the House. 215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers  #BroadbandPrivacy   pic.twitter.com/m1HkVptuNt Fight for the Future has the vote count right; 215 members of the House of Representatives voted for the measure. We decided to dig into whether the group is right about what the bill means for online shopping. ISPs and the bill Fight for the Futureâs tweet might give the misleading impression that ISPs canât already see their customersâ online purchases and sell that information. They can. Congressâ action just makes this explicitly legal. An ISPâs function is to connect its users to websites or online apps, and so it can see nearly everything its users do on the Internet, including what kind of underwear they buy. An advertiser might be interested in purchasing that information from an ISP because then it can predict whether a given user is more likely to respond to an ad for boxers, briefs or tighty-whities. Beyond shopping habits, ISPs and advertisers can glean more significant personal information about their customers from Internet browsing patterns â like thatÂ a spouse is contemplating divorce because he looked up ""best divorce lawyers in my area,"" or that a person has a chronic medical condition because she spent a long time reading certain pages on WebMD. In  October 2016 , the FCC established rules intended to give consumers more control over how ISPs used their data. The rules required ISPs to obtain explicit information from their customers before using and sharing their web browsing history, which would include underwear purchases. The rule also required the ISPs to get consent before sharing other ""sensitive information,"" like Social Security numbers, precise geolocation data and financial or health information. Many Internet companies and trade associations  had already committed  to requiring consumers to opt-in before they can share that sort of information, per guidance from the Federal Trade Commission. But these opt-in rules never went into effect; Congress killed them in March 2017, months before the  December 2017 start date . So ISPs can see and use customersâ web browsing data as they always have. ""Practically speaking, I expect consumers will see no change in how their data is collected and marketed,"" said Brent Skorup, a technology policy research fellow at George Mason Universityâs Mercatus Center. Fight for the Future Campaign Director Evan Greer said Congressâ vote was significant because it gives ISP companies explicit permission to engage in practices that some privacy advocates consider ""abusive,"" and it gives ISPs an incentive to invest in systems to further these practices. ISPs have been expanding the scope of their operations, merging with other varieties of service providers, such as  Verizon purchasing AOL , or AT&Tâs planned deal to  purchase Time Warner, Inc . This, combined with Congressâ reversal of the FCC rules, might encourage ISPs to expand their role in online advertising, said Peter Swire, a professor at Georgia Tech and the chief counselor for privacy during President Bill Clintonâs administration. ""Thereâs a lot of online advertising today,"" Swire said. ""Now the big broadband companies will play more actively in that space."" Those who supported gutting the FCC rules argue that the regulations put ISPs at a disadvantage compared to other Internet companies, like search engines or social media sites, that already sell usersâ data without first getting permission. They also say the rules stifle technology innovation. Privacy advocates, however, say that ISPs have an especially large window into its users Internet habits, and this rule could have opened up the possibility of beginning to enact privacy regulations on other web-based companies. ""This is troublesome because of the larger question: Is privacy opt in or opt out?"" said Jamie Winterton, director of strategy for Arizona State Universityâs Global Security Initiative. ""Can your browser behaviors be bought and sold?"" Privacy protections Though they can see a lot, there are  limitations  to what ISPs can see. Some websites use encryption, so the ISP can see the domain name but not the exact page on that website the user is browsing. A website is encrypted if the address starts with ""https"" not ""http."" For example, if a web user visit the Macyâs website, which is encrypted, their ISP will know theyâre browsing the Macyâs website, but it wonât know if theyâre shopping for underwear, a prom dress or bedding. (The article youâre currently reading is not encrypted.) However, if someone visits MeUndies.com right after visiting VictoriasSecret.com â both encrypted â an advertiser can probably make an educated guess that the person is in the market for some underwear. There are  many more sophisticated ways  an ISP or third party can glean information about a user even when the data is encrypted. Regardless, most ecommerce sites remain unencrypted, Swire said. An Internet user who really does not want an ISP tracking any of their data can use a Virtual Private Network, which, put simply, is a way to scramble all Internet traffic so the ISP and potential hackers canât get at it. But this might not completely eliminate privacy concerns because some VPNs themselves donât fully protect usersâ data. ""If you donât want any of your information out there, youâd have to do all sorts of things,"" Winterton said. ""Itâs a lot to ask of people."" Our ruling Fight for the Future said, ""215 members of Congress just voted to let your ISP spy on what type of underwear you buy and sell that data to advertisers."" ISPs can see most of the websites their customers visit. Congress, with 215 votes from the House, sent a bill to Trumpâs desk that codified ISPsâ ability to sell their customers' web browsing data, including any online underwear purchases that arenât encrypted. Regulations enacted in 2016 would have required ISPs to ask customers for explicit permission to share this data with advertisers or other third parties. But Congress acted before the regulations went into effect. Fight for the Futureâs phrasing â and use of the loaded term ""spy"" â might lead people to think that Congressâ action gave ISPs new freedoms, but they could always view and sell usersâ web browsing information. Now they have Congressâ stamp of approval to do so without getting usersâ permission first. That context is important, so we rate Fight for the Futureâs claim Mostly True.",3/30/17,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/mar/30/fight-future/congress-let-internet-providers-spy-your-underwear/,1,,
"Thirteen Democratic senators ""voted against cheaper medicines"" and took millions from ""big pharma since 2011.""",Viral image about Democratic senators and 'big pharma' is misleading.,"A viral post circulating recently in some of the more liberal corners of social media accuses 13 Democratic senators of allegedly voting against lower drug prices because they were recipients of big money from drugmakers. The post included the names and photographs of 13 Democratic senators â Cory Booker and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Warner of Virginia, and Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania. It also listed dollar amounts the senators were said to have received from ""big pharma."" Several readers asked us to check the postâs accuracy, so we did. (Weâll set aside the misspelling of Bookerâs first name.) The viral image was created by a group called  The Other 98 , which says it fights ""economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy."" We were unable to reach a representative of the group. However, we were able to make pretty solid guesses about the underlying reference. It lines up with the voting results for an amendment  voted on  by the Senate on Jan. 11, 2017. The  amendment  is filled with legislative jargon, but it would basically create a mechanism to promote ""lower prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from Canada."" The measure failed, with 46 votes in favor and 52 against. The 13 Democratic senators targeted in the post were among those 52 votes against. As for the dollar figures, they largely align with donations listed on the OpenSecrets.org site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. In every case, the dollar amounts listed track almost exactly the amounts given to each senator under the category ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" for the 2016 campaign cycle, notwithstanding a few small deviances. The post, however, includes some errors, and its accuracy is undercut by a significant oversimplification: The image gives no indication that the senators also voted for a separate amendment that explicitly sought to lower drug prices. The vote wouldnât actually implement âcheaper medicinesâ There are a couple of issues with considering action against the measure to import drugs from Canada as a vote ""against cheaper medicines."" The vote was more symbolic than substantive. It was an amendment to a Senate budget resolution, which is a non-binding measure that doesnât get signed by the president or become law. Rather, they set a framework for committee chairs to work within when deciding how to spend money. So the measures shouldnât be oversold as direct action. ""Simply put, if adopted by the Senate, the amendment would not have required the United States to begin importing drugs from Canada -- period, full stop,"" said Jeff Giertz, communications director for Booker. ""It would have added language into the budget resolution that would have advised the Senate to spend money in a way that would result in this."" ""Giertz said that Booker supported the same goals, but wanted to see a framework for ensuring the safety of imported drugs included in the amendment."" Donât overlook another vote to amend the same bill Itâs important to know that every one of the 13 senators listed in the meme voted in favor of a  separate  amendment that did urge lower drug prices. This other  amendment  effectively prevented the Senate from considering legislation that did not ""as promised by (President-elect Donald Trump), lower drug prices, as certified by the Congressional Budget Office."" Like the other amendment, this did not pass -- it won only  47 votes in favor, with 51 against . But the fact that all 13 senators listed on the meme voted to support this amendment muddies the conclusion of the meme that they all ""voted against cheaper medicines."" The senators offered varied reasons for opposing the amendment the viral image refers to. For instance: â¢  Booker : ""I support the importation of prescription drugs as a key part of a strategy to help control the skyrocketing cost of medications. Any plan to allow the importation of prescription medications should also include consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards. I opposed an amendment put forward last night that didnât meet this test."" â¢  Coons : The amendment ""didnât meet the safety standards he believes are necessary,"" a spokesman Sean Coit told PolitiFact. â¢  Donnelly : ""I do not believe the best way to address the problem of rising prescription drug prices or to advance an importation policy is through legislation that is designed specifically to take health care away from the people who need it"" -- that is, the Republican-backed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. â¢  Casey : ""Sen. Casey had concerns about whether existing safety standards would apply to wholesalers,"" spokesman John Rizzo told PolitiFact. ""Sen. Casey has spoken with (Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., an amendment sponsor) about this, and the two of them are actively working on legislation that will allow importation."" The numbers shown donât only represent money fromÂ 'big pharma' The assertion that these senators took millions from ""big pharma since 2011"" is also imprecise. Weâll start with what looks like a typo. The dollar amounts shown are generally accurate for the 2016 campaign cycle, but if you were to include the totals going all the way back to 2011, as the meme states, then the amount would be substantially larger than what is shown. Because the point would have been stronger with larger dollar figures, this looks to us like an unintended mistake. However, the ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" category as defined by the Center for Responsive Politics is actually broader than what most reasonable people would consider ""big pharma."" For this purpose, a more accurate subcategory for ""big pharma"" would be the Center for Responsive Politics category ""pharmaceutical manufacturing."" Several of the senators listed on the post rank in the groupâs top 20 recipients of ""pharmaceutical manufacturing money"" during recent election cycles, but not all of them do -- and the amounts for each are smaller than what the meme reflects. Murray made the top 20 list in 2014 and 2016, for a cumulative $265,406. (You can investigate the numbers at the Center for Responsive Politics site  here .) Coons made it in 2012 and 2014 for a cumulative $138,450. Casey made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $231,380. Carper made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $171,300. Menendez and Tester made the top 20 in 2012 ($153,800 and $54,750, respectively), Booker and Warner made it in 2014 ($233,750 and $71,050), and Bennet made it in 2016 ($135,127). These dollar amounts, which are admittedly incomplete, are lower than what the post shows for each senatorâs ""big pharma"" contributions. Then thereâs another caveat we always mention in articles like this one. The industry donation breakdowns tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics doesnât just include donations by fat-cat executives and company political action committees. It also includes donations made by any individual employed by a company in a given industry sector. This can include rank-and-file employees -- and in states with a heavy pharmaceutical presence in the workforce, this can be a significant factor. These states include Delaware, represented by Carper and Coons, and New Jersey, represented by Booker and Menendez. Our ruling The viral image says that 13 Democratic senators ""voted against cheaper medicines"" and took millions from ""big pharma since 2011."" The 13 Democrats did vote against one amendment that was intended to lower drug prices through reimportation of medicines from Canada, and they have each taken money from drugmakers. However, the image leaves a misleading impression that the senators have voted against lowering drug prices. In reality, all 13 senators voted in favor of a different amendment that specifically advocated ""lower drug prices."" In addition, the dollar amounts listed for the senators use an overly broad definition of ""big pharma,"" inflating the amount of money they have taken from the industry. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. EDITOR'S NOTE: We have modifiedÂ our paraphrase of a comment byÂ Giertz to better reflect what he said.

"Democrat Stephen Webber ""voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches.""",Rowden claim of Webber's votes don't account for bill's changes.,"In October, Republican Caleb Rowdenâs campaign uploaded a video to its YouTube channel attacking Democrat Stephen Webber for voting against a bill that would ban sex offenders from playgrounds and child care centers and from coaching children under the age of 17. The Missouri Republican Party also sent out mailers advertising the same claim. Webber ""voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches,"" the video said. Rowden and Webber, both former state representatives, face each other in a battle to fill the 19th Senate District seat vacated by Kurt Schaefer, who couldnât seek re-election because of term limits. The bill in question, Missouri House Bill 62 from 2009, was a lengthy crime bill that changed a number of laws. Among these were the introduction of laws banning child sex offenders from knowingly being within 500 feet of a public park with a playground or swimming pool, or from a child care facility when those under the age of 18 are present, and from serving as a coach, manager or athletic trainer for a sports team with children under 17 years of age. History of the bill Rowden is correct that Webber voted against the final version of this bill when it came back from the state Senate. But Webber voted in favor of the bill before the House sent it to the Senate. So what made him change his vote between April 16 and May 15, 2009? Webberâs campaign manager, Emily Waggoner, explained the reasoning in a phone interview. ""Stephen voted for the original version of the bill that theyâre talking about that prevents all those things from happening, and then it came back from the Senate with this weird exemption language allowing people to exempt themselves from sex offender registries. So he voted for the strongest version of that bill; it came back and it was a bill that had a new exemption in it and he refused to support a weaker version of that bill."" So we took a look into the actual legislation to confirm these changes between the version of the bill that was sent to the Senate and final bill, and found that those changes did exist. The specific part the Webber campaign cites as the reason for voting against the final version of the bill is explained in the bill summary this way: ""Allows an offender of certain misdemeanor sexual offenses to petition to exempt his or her name from the sexual offender registry if he or she meets current qualifications for the removal or exemption and was younger than 19 years of age at the time of the offense."" This text did not exist in the summary of the bill prior to it going to the Senate. Webber wasnât the only member of the House to change his vote after the bill came back from the Senate. The bill that was sent to the Senate was agreed to in the House by a margin of 141 to 9. The final version of the bill was passed in the House by a slightly tighter margin of 124 to 34.Â  Our ruling Rowden said Webber ""voted to allow sex offenders to be within 500 feet of childcare centers and playgrounds, and even voted to allow sex offenders to be coaches."" Thatâs a misleading version of events. Webber actually supported the House version of the legislation in question. But the bill was amended in the Senate to include a provision that allowed some sexual offenders to have their names removed from the sexual offender registry. Webber opposed that addition, his campaign said, and voted against the final bill. There is an element of truth to this claim but not much more.

"Says Richard Burr ""was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave.""","Deborah Ross says Richard Burr voted against a ban on insider trading in Congress, called it brave.","Deborah Ross, the Democratic challenger for Republican Sen. Richard Burrâs seat representing North Carolina in the U.S. Senate, has repeatedly said Burr is a consummate Washington insider. This summer she claimed that Burr ""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."" We rated that  Half True . More recently, she has been claiming Burr voted against a bill that wouldâve banned members of Congress from insider trading. ""It is a fact that Sen. Burr was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress,"" Ross said in their recent debate. ""And he called that vote brave."" Burr doesnât deny the vote in question, but he repeatedly said itâs being blown way out of proportion. He  defended his actions in 2012  after the vote, and again last month at his debate with Ross. We wondered what the real story was. Insider trading Insider trading is when someone uses non-public information to buy or sell stocks to maximize profit. Depending on the circumstances, it can be  legal or illegal . In April 2012, the STOCK Act â which stands for Stop Trading On Congressional Knowledge â specifically said lawmakers could not use their insider knowledge to trade stocks. It also created several new or stronger ethics and transparency provisions for members of Congress and their staffs. President Obama asked Congress to pass the bill in his 2012 State of the Union address. A few months later, he got his wish and signed it into law with much fanfare. It was a rare moment of bipartisan celebration, although Ross is right that Burr was one of three holdouts. Burr said insider trading was already illegal, so there was no need to pass another law singling out members of Congress. ""It is illegal, in law, even for Congress, to trade on insider trading,"" Burr said in response to Rossâ barb at their debate. ""Thatâs the reason I opposed the STOCK Act. North Carolinians did not send me to Washington to duplicate existing law, and thatâs in fact what the STOCK Act did."" Burr, however, is wrong to speak so definitively about that claim. Legal confusion There is no statutory definition of when exactly insider trading becomes illegal, so itâs often up to individual judges or investigators to decide. While Congress was never specifically exempted from insider trading rules, there was widespread disagreement in the legal and financial communities over what officials could or couldnât do. If youâre in the mood for a 59-page legal analysis of the differing opinions,  read this 2011 paper . Or, hereâs a brief synopsis: Some people said the law applied to everyone in Congress. SomeÂ said elected officials had to abide by insider trading laws, but their staffers did not. Some said both elected officials and their staffs were exempt. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission is in charge of policing insider trading, we decided to see what its officials thought at the time. Unfortunately, two high-level officials gave opposite interpretations of the law. Former SEC CEO Arthur Levitt said in 2010 that elected officials and their staffers ""benefit from an exemption that the average investor doesnât benefit from. Theyâre immune from insider trading laws."" However, former SEC director of enforcement Robert Khuzami  said  in 2011 that neither elected officials nor their staffers were ""exempt from the federal securities laws, including the insider trading prohibitions."" SoÂ the STOCK Act at least cleared up confusion from 2012 onward. And at best, it made real changes. Congressional suspicions Regardless of the lack of clarity in the law, we do know that members of Congress and their staffers routinely made timely trades centered around upcoming policy decisions. One 2004 paper found that senators who made stock trades outperformed the market by an impressive 12 percent, on average. ""Since even the best hedge-fund managers find it hard to achieve comparable results, we must conclude that these senators either are better than hedge-fund managers, or that they benefit from privileged information,"" Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, wrote in 2011. Zingales said it was his opinion that members of Congress did participate in insider trading, ""despite the potential cost to their reputations."" In 2010 the Wall Street Journal investigated  allegations of insider trading  by congressional staffers. It found dozens of aides on both sides of the aisle had invested tens ofÂ thousands of dollars in stocks that soon benefitted from their bossesâ policy decisions. One aide nearly doubled his investment in a renewable energy company just before his boss pushed for a new law that benefitted companies like it. Another aide bought thousands of dollars worth of Bank Of America stock just before a report â which her boss was involved in â found in the bankâs favor and sent stock prices surging. Other parts of the STOCK Act Yet even if Burr is right that insider trading laws applied to Congress that whole time â and it appears no one knows the real answer to that â heâs still not correct that the law was purely duplicative. The STOCK Act also strengthened the power of ethics investigators in Congress and expanded transparency requirements â although Congress  quietly rolled back  the transparency requirements within a year of passing the original bill. But is Ross also right that Burr called himself brave for voting against the STOCK Act? Yes, and we found the  transcript  of his remarks on Burrâs own website. ""It's ludicrous,"" Burr said in a February 2012 radio interview, while discussions over the bill were still ongoing. ""That's why Dr. Tom Coburn (a Republican senator from Oklahoma) and I were the two brave souls that walked up and said we shouldn't be doing this."" Burr and Coburn joined with Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico in casting the only ânoâ votes when the bill passed the Senate 96-3. Our ruling Ross said Burr ""was one of only three senators who voted against a ban on insider trading for members of Congress. And he called that vote brave."" Sheâs right about Burrâs vote and the fact that Burr called it brave. Whatâs less clear is whether the STOCK Act simply clarified the law regarding insider trading in Congress, or made actual changes. Regardless, the law did make other changes that Burr ignores when he says his opposition was because the bill was totally duplicative. We rate this claim True.",11/5/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/nov/05/deborah-ross/deborah-ross-says-richard-burr-voted-against-ban-i/,1,,
"Kelly Ayotte ""voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants.""",Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte voted to cut $90 billion from Pell Grants.,"As Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan traded barbs in their last debate before Tuesdayâs election, the subject once again turned to the rising cost of higher education. Ayotte was asked why she had voted for ""budget bills"" that would have cut money for Pell Grants, the federal subsidy for needy undergraduates. ""Thatâs just not true,"" she said. Ayotte said she voted to make ""sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants."" A little later, Hassan, who is running to unseat Ayotte, encouraged people to ""check for themselves"" regarding Ayotteâs votes. ""On March 27, 2015, she voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion,"" Hassan said. PolitiFact decided to check it out -- did Ayotte, who often trumpets her support of Pell Grants, in fact vote to cut funding for the program? We reached out to both campaigns, as well as a couple federal budget policy experts. Hassanâs campaign pointed to Ayotteâs votes on a budget resolution conference agreement in 2015 -- in the Congressional Record,  S. Con. Res. 11  -- and a proposed amendment to it. The first thing to note is that on March 27, 2015, Ayotte voted on a budget resolution -- which is a document that sets guidelines for the appropriations committees. Itâs not a Â binding spending outline and does not initiate cuts itself. ""It doesnât have the effect of law, it doesnât go to the President for signature. Itâs also a broad ranging document that covers a ton of issues, so you could oppose a provision but support the package,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. Itâs a packet of suggestions -- and, crucially, vague ones at that. Budget resolutions only set ""top-line"" numbers in broad spending categories the next budget shouldnât go over. They never get so detailed as to discuss appropriations to individual programs -- including Pell Grants. And again, itâs non-binding. ""You canât really say it cuts a program or it doesnât cut a program. Thatâs pretty impossible,"" said Jason Delisle, of the American Enterprise Institute. So where did the $90 billion figure come from? Hassanâs campaign pointed to remarks made by Shaun Donovan, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote on April 30, 2015, that the Republicanâs budget resolution ""eliminates roughly $90 billion in mandatory funding for the Pell Grant program. That would either require significant cuts in other domestic priorities to make up for lost funding or result in deep cuts to the Pell program."" But thereâs something important to note about Donovanâs statement. It refers to ""mandatory"" funding. If a budget resolution suggests taking away a programâs ""mandatory"" spending, that still means the program can recover those funds through discretionary spending -- spending that Congress reviews every year. This is what Ayotte was referring to when she said she wanted to ""make sure there was annual oversight over the spending of Pell Grants."" Of course, making a programâs spending subject to Congressional approval each year certainly makes it more vulnerable to actual cuts -- especially if total discretionary spending targets go down by $759 billion -- because it would compete for those other dollars in a smaller pool. And thatâs why  several higher education  advocacy groups  denounced  the Republican budget plan. But strictly speaking, making a programâs funding discretionary doesnât actually cut its spending. As noted by the Hassan campaign, Ayotte did vote against an amendment to the budget resolution, put forward by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. According to its statement of purpose, that amendment ""(restored) the $89,000,000,000 in cuts to Federal Pell Grants in the Republican budget."" Republicans, who objected to the assumption their budget resolution would cut Pell Grants, universally voted against it, and Democrats universally voted for it. But Delisle also notes that while statement of purpose for Frankenâs amendment made explicit mention of Pell Grants, the text of the amendment itself didnât. Instead, it simply noted top-line budget categories in the resolution and increased the amount assigned to them. In short, the amendment made the assumption that by reducing or increasingly certain overall top-line spending targets, a certain amount would or wouldnât trickle down to Pell Grants. But it didnât actually point to a spot in the budget resolution where a certain amount of money was allocated to Pell Grants and assign more dollars to the program -- because that spot doesnât exist. Our ruling Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte ""voted for a budget that had $90 billion of cuts to Pell Grants. The day before, she voted against an amendment to that budget that would have restored that $90 billion."" What Ayotte voted on was a budget resolution, a broad outline for spending, which is non-specific and non-binding. Itâs not the same as a vote for an actual budget, which dictates federal spending. Moreover, the resolution didnât call for a cut to Pell Grants. It made the spending discretionary, rather than mandatory. The change would have made the grants more vulnerable, but itâs not the same as a cut . We rate the claim Mostly False.",11/5/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/nov/05/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-voted-cut-90-billi/,1,,
"Says Donald Trump and Ron Johnson ""oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act.""",Russ Feingold's attack on Donald Trump and Ron Johnson on abortion and domestic violence.,"The  tight  Wisconsin  U.S. Senate race  has been marked by attacks made on GOP incumbent  Ron Johnson  and Democratic challenger  Russ Feingold . (Weâve highlighted  20 of them .) But ahead of the Nov. 8, 2016 election, Johnson and his fellow Republicans  are also trying  to tie Feingold to the unpopular Democratic presidential nominee,  Hillary Clinton . And Feingold and  other Democrats  are trying to hitch Johnson to the  equally unpopular  GOP nominee,  Donald Trump . A  Feingold radio ad  released Oct. 26, 2016 makes a number of claims about Johnson and Trump on womenâs issues, including saying they both ""oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act, denying protections to victims of domestic violence."" Letâs check both parts of the attack. Right to choose On abortion generally, Trump has been controversial. In Green Bay in March 2016, he said women should be punished for having an abortion. (Our  In Context item  fleshed out those remarks.) Then, hours later, Trumpâs campaign  posted a statement  saying women are victims of abortion. When it comes more specifically to a womanâs right to choose, Trump went from pro-choice to anti-abortion, as our colleagues noted in  rating True  a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina that Trump had ""changed his mind"" on abortion. As late as 2000, Trump wrote that he was pro-choice. But by 2011, he said he was anti-abortion, a position he has stated as  recently as October 2016 . Trump  has   said , including in his Green Bay  remarks , that he supports exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape. Johnson is also anti-abortion. During his successful campaign to win Feingoldâs seat in 2010, Johnson was asked if he Roe v. Wade was ""settled law.""  He said  the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion Â ""was a real tragedy,"" saying it ""usurped the democratic process."" In this race,  Johnson was endorsed  by Wisconsin Right to Life, which noted his support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,  a 2015 bill  that would have generally banned abortion at 20 weeks and later. And Life News has  urged support  for Johnson, saying he has a ""strong pro-life voting record."" Feingoldâs campaign also pointed out that in 2011, Johnson  co-sponsored  the  Life at Conception Act , which declared ""that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being beginning at the moment of fertilization, cloning, and other moment at which an individual comes into being."" Johnson, however, has supported the three exceptions -- a  position  that drew some  criticism  from conservatives when he challenged Feingold in 2010. Violence Against Women Act The  Violence Against Women Act  was adopted in 1994. When it was reauthorized in 2005, it was set to expire in 2011. New reauthorization votes were taken in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Johnson was among 31 Republican senators  who voted no . The bill passed the Senate, but died in the House. In 2013, the bill passed the Senate again, with Johnson among 22 Senate Republicans  to vote no . The measure then passed the House and was  signed into law . Like the 1994 version, the renewed law makes it easier to prosecute crimes against women in federal court, and provides such services as domestic abuse hotlines and shelters for battered women. The new bill was also extended to women of Native American tribal lands who are attacked by non-tribal residents, as well as to immigrants, gays and lesbians. Itâs worth noting why Johnson said he voted no. Johnson issued  a statement  after his 2012 vote, saying in part: I believe itâs critical to ensure that laws are in place to prevent and deter crime â against both women and men. Regrettably, the debate over the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was completely politicized by the Senate Democratic leadership.  Republicans offered very reasonable  alternatives  to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Senate Democrats today defeated proposals to provide U.S. marshals the tools they need to track sex offenders across state lines. They voted against legislation to establish an interstate database for DNA evidence, to ensure sex offenders are brought to justice regardless or the jurisdiction in which they commit their crimes. And they rejected legislation to provide additional funds to allow law enforcement to pursue justice for hundreds of thousands of women. Johnson also issued a statement following his 2013 vote,  saying  in part: In passing the Violence Against Women Act, the Democrat-controlled Senate turned the renewal of a non-controversial piece of legislation that had a history of strong bipartisan support into a divisive and highly partisan bill.  As a result, the Senate has approved a piece of legislation that sounds nice, but which is fatally flawed. By including an unconstitutional expansion of tribal authority and introducing a bill before the Congressional Budget Office could review it to estimate its cost, Senate Democrats made it impossible for me to support a bill covering an issue I would like to address. Most analysts believe it would add more than $2 billion to the deficit.   I voted for an  alternative  that did not have these serious flaws. That alternative would help deter and prosecute violence against women â without the inclusion of unconstitutional provisions.   Our rating Feingold says Trump and Johnson ""oppose a womanâs right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act."" Trump and Johnson are anti-abortion, though Trump in particular has said he supports exceptions to allow abortion in certain cases. Johnson did vote no on reauthorizing the violence law, but itâs not as though he opposed protections for women; in fact, he voted for alternative measures that did not pass. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",11/3/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/nov/03/russ-feingold/russ-feingolds-attack-donald-trump-and-ron-johnson/,1,,
"Says Russ Feingold ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.""",Did Russ Feingold Social Security votes raise taxes and try to give benefits to illegal immigrants?,"A  Ron Johnson  radio ad that criticizes opponent  Russ Feingold  begins by talking about the federal budget deficit, then turns to one of the most common attack themes in election campaigns:  Social Security . The female narrator in  the ad , which was released Oct. 10, 2016, says Johnsonâs Democratic challenger ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."" Itâs a two-fer sort of claim, combining nearly identical attacks that Johnson has made separately elsewhere. For example, a  TV ad  by the Republican incumbent says Feingold ""voted to increase taxes on Social Security benefits."" https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e846588-f639-4bfd-b092-3704294314d4 And in the  first debate  of the  Wisconsin Senate race , Johnson said Feingold ""voted to tax Social Security benefits"" and ""also voted to give Social Security benefits to people who come into this country illegally."" So, with the Nov. 8, 2016 election looming, letâs check the two parts of the claim from the radio ad. ""Voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors"" Johnsonâs campaign cites Feingoldâs  yes vote  in 1993 on President Bill Clintonâs 1994 federal budget. One provision in the budget  raised income taxes  on Social Security benefits for  middle-class and affluent seniors . A vote for the massive federal budget, of course, is a vote for the overall taxing-and-spending plan. It doesnât necessarily mean support for every one of the thousands of provisions in it. For example, when Johnson was accused of having ""supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age"" for Social Security, our rating was  Mostly False . Part of the evidence cited was Johnsonâs vote for a federal budget plan, not a proposal dealing solely with Social Security. In this case, there was a motion to remove the tax increase from the budget.  Feingold voted  to table the motion -- a vote that helped keep the increase in the budget. Republicans have also posted  a video clip  of Feingold speaking prior to his votes that indicated why he was not opposed to the tax increase. He said he probably would vote for the tax increase because it would be paid only by people who were earning enough money that they were already paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits. So, the vote was to raise taxes only on more affluent Social Security recipients, not all of them. ""Tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants"" Johnsonâs campaign cites a Feingold vote on  an amendment  to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, saying Feingold voted against closing a loophole to ensure that illegal immigrants did not receive Social Security benefits. There was a motion to table the amendment and the motion was approved 50-49, with Feingold in the majority. In other words, the amendment failed. But weâve already rated this part of the claim, when Johnson made it in the 2010 Feingold-Johnson campaign. Our rating was  False . The amendment did not apply to illegal immigrants. It dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal. Illegal immigrants would not have been made eligible for Social Security benefits even if amendment had passed. Our rating Johnson says Feingold ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.""  On a proposal that would have removed a tax increase on Social Security benefits from the 1994 federal budget, Feingold voted no and indicated he was satisfied the increase applied only to higher-income senior citizens. The tax increase wasnât imposed on all Social Security recipients. Feingold did not vote to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. For a statement that has an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",11/3/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/nov/03/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-russ-feingold-social-security-votes-ra/,1,,
"""Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people.""",Did Richard Burr vote to protect tax breaks for companies that move overseas?,"An ad from Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democrat running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a politician beholden to corporate interests. The ad , which first hit the airwaves in mid-October, features a young ex-Marine named Zach. ""He came back from Afghanistan and came home to a job as an electrician,"" the ad says. ""But every year, his paycheck doesnât go as far. He just wants some economic security. Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people like Zach. Folks, thatâs just wrong. Those arenât our values."" We wanted to find out whether Ross was right that ""Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people."" Itâs a frequent refrain of Rossâ campaign, and outside this ad she has repeated the claim  in June ,  in September  and at other times on the campaign trail. Itâs also a line of attack other Democratic politicians across the country have used before â ranging from Barack Obama, in his 2014 State of the Union address, to a failed Senate candidate in Kentucky. But thereâs a major caveat: Variations on this claim have received rulings like  Mostly False  or  Half True  on our Truth-O-Meter, depending on the way it was phrased. Given that the Ross-Burr race is one of the closest in the country, and North Carolina has been particularly hard-hit by the outsourcing of factory jobs, we decided to take a look at how much truth there was to Rossâ claim. Ross' ad is talking about a bill called the ""Bring Jobs HomeÂ Act,"" which Senate Democrats tried to pass in 2012 and 2014. It failed both years due to opposition from Republicans, and both years Burr did vote against it. Burr also joined his fellow Republicans in voting against a 2010 bill that had similar provisions, called the ""Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act."" The goal of the bills There is no tax break for companies that move overseas, so the claim is slightly misleading on that account. There are tax breaks, however, for any U.S. company that relocates â whether itâs to the other side of town or the other side of the world. The bills that Burr voted against would have created a new tax incentive for companies that moved jobs back to the United States from overseas. They also would have exempted overseas moves from the types of relocation that can receive tax breaks. So the claim itself has the facts of the bill basically right, although it leaves room for people to get the wrong impression. The money angle Tax experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the bills were almost entirely symbolic. Thatâs because the punishments or rewards companies might have received wouldâve been insignificant â not nearly large enough to change their behavior and either bring jobs back or stop jobs from leaving. An analysis by Congressâ Joint Committee on Taxation showed the U.S. government would have lostÂ $214 million between 2015 and 2024 if the 2014 version of the bill had passed. But for the sake of not trying to look into the future, letâs just take a look at the 2015 estimates. Companies that outsourced in 2015 would have lost $9 million that year if the bill had passed, the committee found. Meanwhile, companies that insourced wouldâve received $19 million in tax breaks. Those numbers are minuscule. Corporations were expected to pay $341.7 billion in income taxes in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center, a branch of the left-of-center Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The $9 million in extra payments represents 0.0026 percent of the total corporate income taxes. Thatâs a quarter of a hundredth of 1 percent. The $19 million in savings isnât much more significant, representing 0.0056 percent of the total. Wouldn't have changed corporate strategies Tax experts have previously opined, looking at similar numbers, that the bill simply would not have done enough to persuade any major company to change its business plan. ""It adds up to a trivial amount of money,"" James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact for a 2014 fact check. ""Given how many big multinational firms we have, itâs impossible that it has any effect on their behavior."" Howard Gleckman, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, agreed. ""For many multinationals, the credit would be largely meaningless,"" he  wrote . ""Those firms already pay close to a zero U.S. tax rate thanks to their ability to shift income to low-tax countries. With their U.S. tax liability already low, the credit would do almost nothing to encourage them to shift operations to the U.S."" Our ruling Ross said that Burr ""voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people."" PolitiFact has docked points on several versions of this same claim in the past, in large part because it oversimplifies the bills in question and doesnât account for the fact that experts donât think the bills would have done anything to keep jobs in the United States, or bring them back, had the changes become law. Burr did vote against the bills in question â inconsequential though they might have been â so there is a sliver of truth here. But the reality of the situation isnât nearly so cut-and-dried as Ross describes it. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b9f6abfd-ac60-43cb-a2dd-20fbc5f6d903",11/2/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/nov/02/deborah-ross/did-richard-burr-vote-protect-tax-breaks-companies/,1,,
"Chris Koster ""opposed protecting the women of Missouri"" because he ""was one of only four senators to vote against"" a bill ending the practice of making rape victims pay for their own rape kits.",Greitens misses bigger picture on Koster's domestic violence vote.,"In a September press release, Eric Greitens, Missouriâs Republican candidate for governor, said his opponent, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, voted against legislation protecting women from sexual assault and domestic violence. Greitens said Koster voted against a 2007 bill mandating that the state pay for ""rape kit"" medical exams, not the victim of the assault. Koster was a state senator at the time the bill was proposed."" Chris Koster is always quick to tout his âexperience.â But he is totally silent about his record on issues related to sex crimes and violence against women, probably because it is so bad,"" the release reads. It continues: ""He opposed protecting the women of Missouri."" We wanted to know more about Kosterâs stance on the bill, so we decided to investigate Greitensâ claim. More about the bill The legislation, House Bill 583, became law. Besides mandating that the state paid for rape kits, the bill also classified repeated instances of first-degree domestic assault as a Class A felony and established a designated address for sexual assault victims in order to protect their privacy. Greitens is right â Koster was one of four senators who voted against the bill. The Senate passed it with a vote of 29-4. It passed in the House 133-19. But Greitensâ release doesnât provide the full story. We reached out to Kosterâs campaign, who sent us a statement about why Koster opposed the bill. ""The idea Attorney General Koster wants rape victims to pay for their own rape kits is beyond ludicrous,"" the statement read. ""This bill contained a blanket provision that could allow convicted murderers whose trials occurred decades earlier to get out of prison, based on potentially manufactured evidence. He couldn't support that and for that reason opposed the bill,"" the Koster campaign said. The bill allows the Department of Corrections to grant parole to inmates serving time in prison for murdering their spouse or ""domestic partner"" if the inmate can prove that he or she was the victim of repeated domestic violence. To get parole, the inmate must provide evidence of domestic violence, and that evidence could not have been used in the original trial. According to the bill, the evidence could include ""witness statements, hospital records, social services records, and law enforcement records."" The provision allows parole only if the inmate has served 15 years of his or her sentence. The parole board must determine that the prisoner will not break the law again. The inmateâs trial had to have begun before 1991, and the homicide has to have been the personâs first violent felony conviction. Kosterâs campaign staff said Koster objected to witness statements being used as evidence of domestic abuse leading to the murder. Kosterâs position was that under the wording of the bill, the parole board and not the original jury would decide the prisonerâs fate on the basis of the witness statements. ""The bill doesn't provide a standard where the parole board weights (sic) the evidence, i.e. preponderance or without a reasonable doubt. This opens the door to manufactured evidence that would not be weighed by a jury,"" his campaign said. The Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the bill when it was in the legislature, said Colleen Coble, the coalitionâs CEO. Coble said the billâs aim was to allow imprisoned women who killed their partners following an act of domestic violence to have their cases reviewed by the parole board. Before 1991, evidence of domestic violence was not commonly presented as a defense in court, she said. Coble said Koster was supportive of the billâs other provisions, including the measure to have the state pay for medical exams. Kosterâs voting record We wanted to find out more about how Koster voted on other legislation related to sexual violence when he was a state senator. Kosterâs staff provided us with more information. As attorney general, Koster assembled the Domestic Violence Task Force in 2010. The task force suggested 12 changes to Missouriâs domestic violence laws in a 2011 report to the Missouri General Assembly. One of the recommendations was to create more consistent definitions of ""domestic violence,"" ""abuse,"" ""adult,"" ""family"" and ""household member.""Some of the suggestions were folded into a Senate bill that became law that year. As a state senator, Koster sponsored several bills related to sexual assault, though none became law. In 2006, he sponsored a bill that would increase penalties for sexual offenders who fail to register. That year, he also sponsored a bill that would have required lifetime probation for first-time sex offenders. In 2007, he sponsored a bill that would allow victims of sexual assault to register a designated address with the Missouri Secretary of Stateâs office to protect their privacy. That was one of the provisions of the bill Greitens referenced. He also sponsored a bill that year requiring people convicted of felonies to serve a minimum of three years in prison if they failed to register as a sex offender at the time of their crime as required. Our ruling Greitens says Koster voted against a 2007 bill requiring the state to pay for rape victimsâ medical exams. In reality, the bill did more than that. Koster says he objected to wording that made it possible for convicted murderers to be granted parole by claiming they were victims of domestic abuse. Koster said the language made it possible for murderers to manufacture evidence to be released before the completion of their sentence. Greitens is cherry-picking one part of the legislation to paint his opponent as soft on domestic abuse.

"""Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools.""",Levar Stoney weakly claims that Jack Berry voted to cut $23.8 million from Richmond schools.,"Thereâs a photo of a sad-looking girl sitting at a school desk on a new flier being circulated by Richmond mayoral candidate Levar Stoney. ""Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our public schools,"" the handbill states in capital letters. Berry also is among the seven candidates in the mayorâs race. Heâs held a number of key administrative posts in the Richmond region but never has held elective office. So we wondered if he had, indeed, voted to cut millions from city schools, as Stoney said. Footnotes on Stoneyâs flier base the claim on an April 17, 2012, article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that updated a funding feud between Mayor Dwight C. Jones and the cityâs School Board. The controversy began in February 2012, when the board passed a school budget with $263.7 million in projected expenses but only $239.9 million in projected revenues. Rather than cut expenses, the board opted to approve its underfunded budget and ask Jones and the Richmond City Council to make up the difference. Jones responded in March by appointing a task force of 11 public and private executives to look for savings in the School Boardâs budget that wouldnât hurt classroom instruction. Berry, a former Richmond budget director, was one of the appointees. The panel hired two outside consultants, including former Richmond City Manager Robert C. Bobb, to find possible short- and long-term cuts. The consultantsâ $35,000 fee was paid by the Greater Richmond Chamber Foundation. Â  On April 16, 2012, the panel voted 10-1 to recommend $23.8 million in cuts to the School Boardâs proposed budget. Berry voted with the majority. An article in the next dayâs Times-Dispatch - footnoted in Stoneyâs flier - said the task force ""leaned heavily"" on the consultantâs recommendations in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. The list included: â¢cutting 20 teacher positions; â¢cutting 25 teacher aides; â¢cutting 50 non-teacher positions; â¢imposing three furlough days; â¢changing various health care benefits; â¢changing the structure of plant service and security; and â¢eliminating the employee bonus pool. Stoneyâs flier calls the package of cuts ""Berryâs plan,"" but thereâs nothing in The Times-Dispatchâs coverage that suggests he was the mastermind. To the contrary, the article cited by Stoney says the task force ""heavily leaned"" on the recommendations of its consultants in finalizing its list of proposed cuts. It also should be noted that Berry was not one of the two people Jones appointed as co-chairmen of the panel. A week later, Jones asked City Council to contribute an additional $5.1 million for education - far below the extra $23.8 million the School Board sought. The mayor rejected the task forceâs recommendations for furlough days and eliminating health benefits for the school systemâs pre-Medicare retirees. The council increased that amount to $5.6 million. In the end, Richmond schools were left with a $250 million budget for the 2012-13 school year, anchored by a $129.4 million appropriation from the City Council and with the rest coming from state and federal sources. That was slightly higher than the $249.1 million for the 2011-12 school year, which included $123.8 million in city funds. Our ruling Stoneyâs flier says, ""Jack Berry voted for a plan to cut $23.8 million from our schools."" The Richmond School Board passed a budget in 2012 that exceeded its revenues by $23.8 million and asked the city to make up the difference. Mayor Jones refused and appointed an 11-member advisory committee, which included Berry, to find savings. The panel voted 10-1, with Berryâs support, to recommend a plan that itemized $23.8 million in cuts to the boardâs proposed budget. The City Council largely adopted that plan. Stoneyâs statement suggests that Berry had an official role in the budget deliberations. He didnât. Berry served as an adviser to the mayor with instructions to find efficiencies. He didnât have a say in the actual appropriation of city funds for education; that remained in the hands of the City Council. Itâs also misleading to say, as Stoney does, that the plan ""cut"" $23.8 million from schools. Most of that sum was hoped-for new money from the City Council that the School Board never received. Â  So Stoneyâs statement contains an element of truth but ignores important facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",10/31/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/31/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-weakly-claims-jack-berry-voted-cut-23/,1,,
"Says Joe Heck ""voted to shut down the government.""",Catherine Cortez Masto claims Joe Heck supported the 2013 government shutdown.,"In the first and likely last Nevada U.S. Senate  debate , Democratic candidate Catherine Cortez Masto accused her opponent, Republican Joe Heck, of supporting the 2013 government shutdown. While answering if theyâll pledge to never shut down the federal government, Cortez Masto quickly accused Heck of saying one thing on stage and doing another in office. ""Congressman Heckâs already done it,"" she said as both candidates raised their hands. ""He voted to shut down the government and continued with the sequestration, so I donât know why heâs raising his hand."" The former Democratic attorney general continued to hammer the same point (her campaign said she mistakenly said ""sequestration"" instead of shutdown) throughout the hour-long debate, which Heck fervently denied. And at least  one outside group  has made the same claim in a television ad. Heck was initially on the side of House Republicans who led the budget standoff, but the 16-day shutdown and various votes are all more complex than Cortez Masto implies. Government shutdown Cortez Masto was referring to the October 2013  two-week budget stalemate  between congressional Republicans and President Barack Obama over funding for the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans at the time attempted to use legislation meant to finance the government as leverage to roll back portions of the 2013 health care law, with Senate Democrats and the president dismissed as dangerous political maneuvring. During the deadlock, many governmental services were placed on hold, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed or asked to work without pay. The stalemate finally ended two weeks later, with Republicans  backing down  to avoid the government defaulting on its debts. Heck, first elected to Congress in 2010, was in office through the shutdown. Cortez Mastoâs campaign cited a Sept. 30, 2013, vote as the vote to  shut down the government , and claims that Heck and House Republicans then voted 16 times against efforts to reopen the government. Meanwhile, Heckâs campaign is adamant that he voted for every bill to fund the government that came to the House floor, including the final bill that ended the shutdown. (A frustrated Heck said multiple times in the debate that there was ""never a vote to shut down the government."") So which candidate is right? Itâs true that Heck did join with the majority of House Republicans in supporting government spending bills widely viewed at the time of having no chance of passing because they defunded or delays portions of the Affordable Care Act. Polls taken immediately  after the shutdown  indicated that voters blamed Republicans more than the president over the standoff. Cortez Mastoâs campaign said she was referring to a  Sept. 30 vote  on a motion to ""recede and concur,"" as the measure to ""shut down the government,"" which had the practical effect of funding the government until December and delaying some requirements in the new health care law for a year. Heck joined a majority of Republicans in voting for the  continuing resolution  despite the well-publicized threat of a  presidential veto , and said in a  statement  that the House vote reflected what the American people wanted. Cortez Masto campaign spokesman Zach Hudson said the vote essentially equates to voting to shut down the government, as it came on the last day before the shutdown would begin and in the face of Democrats flatly rejecting any spending bill with health care law riders attached. ""Congress has one key duty in the Constitution: pass spending bills that fund the government,"" Hudson said in an email. ""Clearly, Republicans cared more about defunding the Affordable Care Act than keeping the government open."" Cortez Mastoâs campaign sent us a list of  16 votes  taken by Heck during the shutdown, all of which were successful Republican votes to table, or kill, Democratic procedural motions to bring the clean spending bill up for a vote. That doesnât necessarily equate to a vote prolonging the standoff â all the votes cited would have only given Democrats the opportunity to bring a clean spending bill to the floor for an up-or-down vote. Heck never outright said whether or not heâd support a hypothetical clean funding bill, but after 16 days of the shutdown, the Senate approved a bipartisan ""clean"" spending bill funding the government through JanuaryÂ 2014 on an  81-18  margin. Heck and 86 other House Republicans then voted with Democrats to approve the spending bill, which was promptly signed by the president. In a  statement  after the vote, Heck said he was "" deeply disappointed "" that spending changes werenât addressed but that ""government by crisis is not an effective way to govern."" The   Las Vegas Sun  characterized his actions as a ""classic Heck move,"" detailing multiple times where he ""held the party line"" until the last minute and ended up voting for a compromise final deal. But Heck was right in that there was never any up-or-down vote on some sort of a ""government shut-down bill,"" and all of the measures Heck voted on would have funded the federal government. Heckâs campaign also sent PolitiFact a list of 15 other bills that either funded the government entirely with health care riders attached, or funded individual agencies in a piecemeal manner. Senate Democrats rejected those measures entirely, saying they would only accept a ""clean"" funding bill. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baulta said those votes backed up the candidateâs assertion during the debate that he voted for ""every piece of legislation"" to open the government back up. ""At the end of the day, Dr. Heck voted for the non-procedural bills to keep the government open, voted for the bills to fund important government programs, and voted for the final bill to re-open the government,"" Baluta said in an email. ""Dr. Heck preferred negotiating versus the type of brinksmanship and refusal to compromise that led to the shutdown."" PolitiFact previously gave Florida Sen. Marco Rubio a  Mostly False  rating for saying that he was ""never in favor of shutting down the government,"" but Republican senators in the minority at the time ended up voting against ""clean"" funding bills to maintain the shutdown. Rubio also voted against the final funding bill that ended the shutdown, which Heck voted for. Our ruling Cortez Masto claimed that Heck ""voted to shut down the government."" Heck did vote for many pieces of legislation that technically would have funded the government, but the political reality was that all of those proposals were doomed to fail because they sought to undo at least part of the Affordable Care Act. Heck was cagey on his support for a ""clean"" spending bill throughout the shutdown, but did break from the majority of his party and joined with Democrats in voting for the spending bill that ended the shutdown. Because Cortez Masto is oversimplifying the issue and how Heck voted, we rate her statement as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/373aadb6-21d8-45b1-bf07-a44bc13a55f9",10/20/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/20/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-claims-joe-heck-supported-2/,1,,
"""During his 18-year Senate career, (Russ Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right. â¦ (He) promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows.""","Testing Ron Johnson claim on Russ Feingold, judges and Second Amendment.","U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson took aim at challenger Russ Feingold in a  campaign ad on the Second Amendment . In it, Johnson claimed he will protect the rights of gun owners, but Feingold wonât. ""Your right to keep and bear arms, your ability to protect your family is at risk,"" Johnson said in the ad, which was  posted online in August 2016 . ""Sen. Feingold promises to protect those rights, but that's not what his record shows."" Johnson, a first-term Republican from Oshkosh, is  mired in a tight re-election race  with Feingold, a Democrat whom Johnson ousted in 2010. While carrying a shotgun in one hand and ammo in the other, Johnson in the ad references the vacant U.S. Supreme Court seat (""One more liberal justice will flip the court"") and says he has ""held firm defending the Second Amendment and will continue to do so."" Not so with Feingold, Johnson claims: ""During his 18-year Senate career, (Feingold) supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right, and heâd do it again if elected to a fourth term."" That last sentence is key because it contains a specific factual assertion that Johnson uses to conclude Feingold would not protect the rights of gun owners â namely that Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Johnson also says that while Feingold ""promises to protect those rights,"" his voting record shows the opposite. But do the facts really support Johnsonâs conclusion? Letâs take a look. Confirmation votes and court rulings When asked for backup, a Johnson campaign spokesman cited Feingoldâs votes in the Senate to confirm the appointment of three U.S. Supreme Court justices â Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor â who dissented in major gun rights cases. In the 2008 case  District of Columbia v. Heller , the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives people an individual right to carry a gun for protection and is not merely a collective right tied to participation in a militia. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented, with Breyer writing he did not think the Second Amendment protects an absolute right to own a gun, but instead "" protects militia-related, not self-defense-related, interests ."" (Sotomayor was not yet on the court.) Two years later in  McDonald v. City of Chicago , the Supreme Court effectively extended Heller. The court ruled that the Second Amendment, through the 14th Amendment, applies to states just as it does to the federal government. Breyer and Ginsburg dissented here too, as did Sotomayor. (Feingold opposed the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who cast a majority vote in support of both Heller and McDonald. The remaining Supreme Court justices who participated in those cases were appointed before Feingold became a senator in 1993, except for John Roberts, who is discussed below.) Thus, there is some truth to Johnsonâs claim insofar as Feingold voted to appoint three justices who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment gives people an individual right to possess a gun. But hereâs what Johnson left out of the ad: Feingold also voted to confirm judges whose decisions have strengthened gun rights. For example: â¢  Feingold voted to confirm Chief Justice Roberts , who voted in the majority of both Heller and McDonald. â¢  Feingold voted to confirm Wisconsin native Diane Sykes  as a judge to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the 2011 case  Ezell v. Chicago , Sykes authored a  court decision  that invalidated a city of Chicago ban on gun ranges within city limits. â¢  Feingold voted to confirm 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Hardiman , who in 2013 said the Second Amendment  should protect an individualâs right to possess a handgun outside the home . â¢  Feingold voted in 2003 to confirm 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Carlos Bea , who earlier this year joined a  ruling that found a California countyâs ordinance  prohibiting gun stores from within 500 feet of residential areas violated the Second Amendment. And while Feingold has said he favors mandating  background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows , he also has said he was  pleased with the outcome in Heller  and he has explicitly expressed  support for an individualâs right to own a gun . ""Iâve long believed that the Second Amendment grants citizens a right to own firearms,""  Feingold said in 2010 . Our rating In a campaign ad, Johnson said Feingold ""supported judges who voted to deny your individual Second Amendment right."" Feingold did vote to appoint judges who, after being confirmed, disagreed that the Second Amendment provides for an individual right to possess a gun. But Johnson failed to mention in the ad that Feingold also voted to appoint judges who have issued rulings strengthening gun rights. And Feingold has stated clearly he supports an individualâs right to own a gun. Because Johnsonâs statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.",10/19/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/19/ron-johnson/testing-ron-johnson-claim-russ-feingold-judges-and/,1,,
"""Sen. (Richard) Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act.""","In N.C. Senate race, claim by Democrat Deborah Ross against GOP's Richard Burr is misleading.","In a recent  campaign ad , North Carolina Democrat Deborah Ross blasted her opponent, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, for voting against the landmark Violence Against Women Act. ""Sen. Burr voted no on the Violence Against Women Act,"" a narrator says in the ad, while the text, ""Richard Burr: Opposed Violence Against Women Act,"" appears on the screen, along with a citation for a bill considered in the Senate in 2012. Hereâs a screenshot from the ad: Is Rossâ ad correct? In part, but it it leaves out important context. What was Burr voting for? First, we should note that the ad used some loose language about what Burr was actually voting on. The 2012 vote referenced in the ad was for a  reauthorization  bill -- that is, an updating of the existing Violence Against Women Act, which had  lapsed in 2011 . Burr was not in Congress when the act itself was initially passed in 1994; he was sworn in for his first term in the U.S. House the following year, in 1995. The 2000 and 2005 votes Congress voted to reauthorize the act in both 2000 and 2005, and both legislative efforts were fairly uncontroversial. For the 2000 effort, Burr was in the House, and he voted in favor of the reauthorization, which was  passed  by the overwhelming margin of 415-3. While that version didnât become law, another version did become law during that Congress; it passed the House by  voice vote . Individual House membersâ votes arenât recorded in a voice vote, but they are usually only held for non-controversial measures. By the time the 2005 reauthorization effort rolled around, Burr had been elected to the Senate. The reauthorization bill passed the Senate by  unanimous consent , a process by which senators are given a chance to object to a bill and, if there no objections are made, the bill is deemed passed. So Burr would not have opposed the 2005 reauthorization. The 2012 vote The 2012 reauthorization effort was far more controversial than the previous two, since it involved changes that some social conservatives found objectionable. At the time, the Democrats controlled the presidency and the Senate, while the Republicans controlled the House. The Senate bill would ""allow Indian tribal courts to try certain non-Indians in some cases of domestic violence on reservations, expand the number of temporary visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence and extend the protections of that act to gay men and lesbians,"" the  New York Times   reported  at the time. These provisions were  anathema  to many conservatives, and when faced with a vote on  April 26, 2012 , Burr was one of 31 Republicans to vote against it, while 15 Republicans voted for it. Overall, the measure passed the chamber by a 60-31 margin. Instead, Burr  voted  for a failed Republican-sponsored  amendment  that would have stripped out some of the elements of the bill that were controversial to Republicans. We were unable to find a contemporaneous explanation by Burr on the reason for his vote through Google or Nexis. The only  comment  he made on the bill to a media outlet came was procedural rather than substantive, when he said that he thought there were more urgent bills for the chamber to prioritize than the reauthorization. Ultimately, the Republican-led House passed a version that omitted the provisions of the Senate bill that conservatives opposed. The House and Senate were unable to come to an agreement, and the measure was dead for the duration of that Congress. Itâs worth noting that Politico reported on  March 14, 2012 , that the Democratic effort to push a vote on the Violence Against Women Act in the spring of 2012 was to make it a ""political weapon."" ""Republicans have several objections to the legislation, but instead of making changes, Schumer wants to fast-track the bill to the floor, let the GOP block it, then allow Democrats to accuse Republicans of waging a âwar against women,â "" the Politico story said. ""Itâs fodder for a campaign ad, and itâs not the only potential 30-second spot ready to spring from Senate leadership these days."" With this ad, that mission was accomplished. The 2013 vote After the failure to get the two chambers to agree on a single version in 2012, the new Congress took up the effort again in 2013. Partisan control of each part of government remained the same in 2013, and the reauthorization effort played out in a similar fashion. Republicans pursued an amendment to strip out some of the elements they found problematic, such as the provisions related to native Americans and gender identity. On Feb. 7, 2013, the amendment failed by a  34-65  margin, with Burr voting in favor of it. Then, on  Feb. 12, 2013 , the Senate passed the original measure, 78-22. Burr was among a handful of Republican senators who switched their position and supported the bill. In fact, Burr has subsequently trumpeted elements of this bill. Burr joined with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to introduce theÂ  Child Protection Compact Act , which was enacted as part of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This provision ""seeks to protect and rescue children from trafficking by creating âChild Protection Compactsâ between the United States and countries with significant numbers of children in human trafficking,"" Burrâs Senate  website  says. On the other hand, the Ross camp argues, the refusal of Republicans to approve the original bill resulted in a year-long delay in the reauthorization, which kept sexual violence awareness and assistance programs on college campuses from being established, even though reports of sexual assault on college campuses were at an  all-time high . So where does this leave us? The Ross camp argues that the ad is accurate since it said that Burr voted against the 2012 version of the bill. They have a point, but making this argument requires ignoring that Burr voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act three times -- in 2000, 2005 and 2013 -- even as he voted against it once, in 2012. The Ross camp also argues that the 2012 vote is important because Burr opposed -- and even voted to strip -- provisions involving LGBT and native Americans. They also have a point here, but their argument would have been stronger had the ad specifically cited Burrâs actions toward LGBT and native Americans. The ad makes no such distinctions; a viewer would be left to assume that he opposed anything to combat violence against women. Finally, we think itâs relevant to note here that, according to Politico, the Democrats specifically teed up this vote to put Republicans in a bind so they could use their votes in campaign ads -- a tactic that both parties have used when they are in a position to do so. Our ruling Rossâ ad said Burr ""voted no on the Violence Against Women Act."" Burr did vote against the 2012 version of the lawâs reauthorization, which was important because it effectively meant delaying the revival of an act that had expired. However, theÂ ad ignores thatÂ three other times over 13 years Burr voted for a reauthorization of the same law. We rate the statement Half True.",10/18/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/18/deborah-ross/nc-senate-race-democrat-deborah-ross-ad-against-go/,1,,
"Sen. Johnny Isakson voted for a trade agreement, ""with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs.""",Barksdale cherry picks numbers to attack Isakson on trade.,"The latest polls indicate Democrat Jim Barksdale has an uphill battle against two-term incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson in Georgia. Barksdale, a multi-millionaire businessman, has pounced on an issue where he thinks Isakson is vulnerable -- trade agreements and their connection to lost jobs in the state. In his latest ad, he makes a statement about Isaksonâs vote on Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. In a recent campaign video, Barksdale said, ""Johnny voted for PNTR with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs."" Isakson, who has been in Congress since 1999, faces Barksdale and Libertarian candidate Allen Buckley in the Nov. 8 general election. Did Isakson vote for legislation that cost the state jobs? PolitiFact Georgia decided to look into the statement. We reached out to the candidateâs camps for some background. Barksdaleâs campaign spokesperson Gregory Minchak said the number comes from a 2014  Economic Policy Institute study  that found millions of jobs were displaced after the agreement with China, including 93,700 in Georgia. For some perspective on the stateâs relationship with China in recent years, Isaksonâs spokesperson Marie Gordon pointed to a 2015  Georgia Department of Economic Development study  that says the stateâs exports to China totaled $2.6 billion, ranking 12th among Georgiaâs top exporter nations. The stateâs imports from China totaled $19.7 billion, making China 7th among Georgiaâs top importer nations. It may be important to note Georgia has a Republican governor and legislature, and Gov. Nathan Deal has made multiple trips to the country as governor. Isaksonâs campaign also referenced a  Heritage Foundation study  that says the U.S. economy  added  over 3 million net new jobs. Isaksonâs record Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China have been in effect since 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed a bill normalizing relations into law. Trade conditions with China previously had to be renewed on an annual basis. Isakson was first elected as a representative to Congress in 1999. He   voted for the bill  to normalize trade with China in May 2000, and it was signed into law by Clinton in October 2000. Isakson is also Â in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement to reduce barriers to trade in Pacific Rim countries while curbing Chinaâs influence in the area. The agreement still needs to be passed by Congress. Barksdale says later in the ad he will not vote for ""bad"" trade deals and is opposed to corporate tax breaks. Throughout the campaign, the investment manager has channeled the anti-establishment nature of Sen. Bernie Sanders more than that of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Isaksonâs counterattack ads have called Barksdale a hypocrite, and said his fortune comes from companies that outsource jobs to China. Since then, the strongest effort to scale back trade with China came in 2005 (the year Isakson entered the Senate) when then-Rep. Sanders led an effort to repeal the bill due to jobs being lost overseas. The Math The 2014  study from the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute  found ""3.2 million jobs were lost or displaced"" by trade with China between 2001 and 2013. Georgia lost 93,700 jobs, putting the state at number ten for jobs lost in the country. The report concludes, ""Since China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, the massive growth of trade between China and the United States has had a dramatic and negative effect on U.S."" Experts say these are some of the most dismal jobs numbers cited in reference to trade with China. The U.S. International Trade Commission disputes the EPIâs methodology. Spokesperson Matthew McAlvanah said in an email, ""up to half of all U.S. imports are intermediate goods that go into supporting U.S. production (and U.S. jobs). Many other imports are goods we do not produce at all in the United States, which have no impact on U.S. employment."" In short, importing a good does not mean an American job is lost if the good cannot be grown or made in America. Some studies have found an increase in jobs since the billâs passage. Most notably, the  Heritage Foundation study  citing U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers refutes the idea that trade with China has led to job loss. It says, ""from 1999 to 2011, the U.S. economy  added  over 3 million net new jobs."" To figure out how these relations work, a  2011 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service  sums the situation up well: ""U.S. firms that use China as the final point of assembly for their products, or use Chinese-made inputs for production in the United States, are able to lower costs and become more globally competitive... On the other hand, many analysts argue that growing economic ties with China have exposed U.S. manufacturing firms to greater, and what is often perceived to be âunfairâ competition from low-cost Chinese firms. They argue that this has induced many U.S. production facilities to relocate to China, resulting in the loss of thousands of U.S. manufacturing jobs."" Additionally, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has argued in favor of PNTR with China, saying it, ""is vital to our national economic prosperity."" Our ruling Barksdale said his Â opponent in Georgiaâs U.S. Senate race voted for trade legislation Â ""with China costing Georgia 93,000 jobs."" Barksdale is correct that Isakson voted for the bill to normalize trade with China in 2000 and cites a 2014 number that said Georgia lost 93,700 jobs. One prominent study shows that. But other studies show the state actually gained jobs over the long run. Barksdale cherry picks his studies on this issue to make a point.

"Says Colorado congressional candidate Morgan Carroll ""voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries.""","NRCC: Morgan Carroll voted to let welfare recipients use benefit cards at strip club, pot shop ATMs.","A Republican group has launched a racy ad saying Colorado state Sen. Morgan Carroll, a Democratic congressional candidate, voted to allow welfare recipients to use public benefit cards at ATMs in strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries. The National Republican Congressional Committeeâs ad shows how down and dirty the race between Carroll and Republican incumbent Rep. Mike Coffman is getting in the final sprint to Election Day. Theyâre fighting over suburban Denverâs 6th Congressional District, one of the nationâs most competitive swing districts. ""Career politicians waste lots of money. Morgan Carroll is one of the worst,"" the narrator says at the beginning of  the ad, titled ""Clubs."" ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries,""Â the narrator continues as the video shifts from Carroll addressing the Legislature to her standing at a podium in front of a red neon silhouette of a nude female figure and the words ""STRIPPERS""Â and ""MORGAN CARROLL"" on a brick wall. There's a row of marijuana-filled jars beside the senator. ""It's enough to make you ask, 'What's Morgan Carroll thinking?' Welfare for lap dances? Morgan Carroll is careless with our money,""Â the ad concludes. We examined the claim that ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" The facts are fairly straightforward. Carroll was among a dozen Democratic senators who voted against final passage of a 2015 bill to prohibit welfare recipients from using state-issued  electronic benefit transfer (or EBT) cards  to obtain cash from ATMs at pot shops and strip clubs. Low-income families use these debit cards to buy ""essential goods"" such as food and clothing and to help pay for utilities and rent. Senate Bill 65 , which became law, expanded on existing state law prohibiting people from using the cards to withdraw ATM cash at liquor stores, casinos and gun shops. Federal law already required states to prevent people receiving public benefits from using EBT cards at liquor stores, gambling and adult entertainment venues. Colorado also has had trouble preventing people from withdrawing ATM cash totalling hundreds of thousands of dollars at casinos and liquor stores, according to  Watchdog.org . State officials and lawmakers  warned that Colorado would face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against EBT card use at strip clubs. There were also concerns about a federal crackdown after  several reports  of people using the benefit cards at shops selling medical or recreational marijuana -- a drug thatâs legal under state law but illegal under federal law. ""We stand to lose a lot if we don't show we are trying"" to prevent the use of tax money for marijuana, Republican Sen. Vicki Marble, a primary sponsor of the bill, told theÂ  Associated Press  last year. ""The growers here put in a lot of time and effort. A raid would be absolutely devastating to our state."" Why did Carroll -- along with many other Democratic senators -- vote against the bill? ""The reason she voted against it was because of 'banking deserts,' where many poor people don't have"" bank ATMs in their neighborhoods, said Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich. Removing their ability to get cash from ATMs at the many marijuana dispensaries that dot Colorado cities and towns hampers low-income familiesâ ability to access money to purchase legitimate products elsewhere, he added. Â  According to  the Atlantic  magazine, a March study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on the increase of ""banking deserts"" found that ""lower-income communities and communities of color have historically and disproportionately limited access to mainstream banking services."" This makes it harder for people in these communities to manage their finances and build wealth, the study said. Democratic lawmakers had repeatedlyÂ defeated similar legislation, arguing that improper ATM withdrawals at strip clubs,Â liquor stores, casinos represent a tiny fraction of the total use of cash-assistance cards, the  Denver Post  reported. Critics also note that the 2015 law doesn't prevent someone on welfare from using their EBT card to make a withdrawal at a supermarket ATM and then go spend the cash at a pot shop or a strip club. Our ruling NRCC says, ""Carroll voted to allow welfare recipients to use your tax dollars at ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries."" There's slightly more to this than the NRCC lets on: Carroll voted, unsuccessfully, to allowÂ welfare recipients to continue withdrawingÂ money from ATMs at strip clubs and pot dispensaries.Â  Carrollâs spokesman said the senator voted against the bill thatÂ prohibited people from using public benefit cards for cash withdrawals at strip clubs and marijuana dispensaries because she was concerned about the impact on residents of poor neighborhoods where there are few -- if any -- banking services. State officials and lawmakers warned that Colorado could face financial sanctions for failing to comply with federal prohibitions against the use of benefit cards at adult entertainment venues. With that additional information in mind, weÂ rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db00eb39-eb87-464b-92df-ce08bfbe0d45",10/13/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/13/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-morgan-carroll-voted-let-welfare-recipients-u/,1,,
"Says ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed.""",Super PAC yanks ad about Portman's climate change views.,"ClearPath Action Fund, a conservative clean-energy and environmental PAC, cheered U.S. Sen. Rob Portman in a  digital ad , calling him a ""clean energy champion."" The ad said of the Republican senator, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" PolitiFact previously  looked into  how many Republicans in Congress say they believe that climate change is real,Â and caused by human activity. The Republican lawmakers we identified who affirm climate change included  Rep. Michael Grimm, N.Y .;  Sen. Susan Collins, Maine ;  Sen. Lamar Alexander, Tenn.;   Sen. Mark Kirk, Ill .;  Rep. Chris Smith, N.J .;  Sen. Bob Corker, Tenn. ;  Sen. John Thune, S.D .; and  Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, N.J . Portman didnât make PolitiFactâs list, so we wanted to clarify his climate change stance. We asked ClearPath Action Fund for the sources they used to champion Portmanâs position, and a spokesman sent us three links. The first two were votes on amendments to the Keystone XL Pipeline Act in January 2015 (which was after PolitiFact did its roundup of Republicans who believe in climate change). The climate change amendments were only symbolic gauges of the ""sense of the Senate.""Â Portman voted ""yea"" on the first, introduced by Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, ""to express the sense of the Senate that climate change is real and not a hoax."" That amendment passed. Portman also voted in support of a second amendment by Republican Sen. John Hoeven, a Keystone bill sponsor, which said that human activity affects climate change, but still supported the passage of the pipeline bill. That amendment fell short of the required 60 by one vote, and Hoeven himself voted against it. Â  So far, so good for ClearPath Action Fund. Here's how one wrong word â ""significantly"" â pulls theÂ PAC's praise for Portman's recordÂ into negative territory.Â  A Democrat, Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, inched the global warming language a step further, calling for a vote on an amendment that statedÂ ""human activity significantly contributes to climate change."" The adverb represents the crux of the partisan divide over climate change. The word ""significantly"" was significant enough for Portman to vote against that amendment, along with almost all of his fellow Republicans. Collins, Kirk, Alexander, Lindsey Graham (S.C.)Â and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.)Â broke party lines and voted in favor.Â  PortmanÂ has explained in  interviews  that he doesnât want to qualify the impact that human activity has on the climate because ""scientists have different views on that."" These word gymnastics are necessary for Portman because of his large constituency in  Ohio coal country . Coal-burning power plants provide 44 percent of the electricity used in the U.S., but are the biggest contributor to air pollution, according to the  Union of Concerned Scientists .Â  ""Sense of the Senate resolutions are done for messaging reasons, either in an attempt to move the policy debate, or to provide political cover of some sort. I think you had both types in play with the Keystone vote,"" said David Jenkins, president at Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. More recently, Portman voted for an amendment proposed by  Graham  that stated, ""Climate change is real; human activity contributes to climate change,"" and that ""the United States should be a world leader in addressing climate changeâ¦(and) Congress has a responsibility to take actions that reduce emissions and combat climate change..."" Absent, again, is the word ""significantly."" But it is in the language of the ClearPath Action ad: ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" ClearPath Actionâs communications director, Darren Goode, responded immediately to PolitiFact via email, and said the group had made an ""honest mistake"" by including the s-word. ""We have already pulled that video down and will fix it to reflect that,"" Goode wrote. Â  While ClearPath Action confers ""clean energy champion"" status to Portman, at least two other environmental groups beg to differ. The National Resources Defense Council has  regularly  hammered  Portman Â for sponsoring such measures as a budget amendment to allow states to opt out of the 1970 Clean Art Act and Clean Power Plan requirements for cutting carbon pollution. Likewise, the League of Conservation Voters gives Portman aÂ  low Â ratingÂ on their scorecard for his voting record on environmentally impactful measures. Our ruling An ad by ClearPath Action said, ""Rob Portman voted for the bipartisan bill to affirm climate change is real, humans significantly contribute to it and it needs to be addressed."" While Portman did vote for a bipartisan bill recognizing climate change as a threat in need of action, that bill did not include the word ""significantly."" Portman has voted against other amendments when they include the word ""significantly,"" and has voted for amendments that do not quantify how much human activity affects climate change. ClearPath Action has since discontinued the ad, admitted the mistake and pledged to release a corrected version.

"""Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks.""",Ad claims Kelly Ayotte voted for billion dollar tax breaks for 'big oil'.,"As the U.S. Senate race heats up, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took out an ad bashing Republican incumbent Kelly Ayotteâs record on climate. The 30-second spot takes aim at Ayotteâs ties to ""big oil."" ""Kelly Ayotte voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks, and they gave her campaign contributions,"" the narrator says. PolitiFact decided to see if there was any truth to the claim. Letâs look at Ayotteâs votes first. Politifact has looked at similar claims, like when the Senate Majority PAC said former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown ""voted to give oil companies big tax breaks."" PolitiFact found that claim  Mostly True . In this fact-check, weâll focus on Ayotteâs votes. Weâll tackle campaign contributions separately. The DSCC pointed us to Ayotteâs votes in  2011  and  2012  against measures that would have stripped existing tax breaks from the ""big five"" oil companies: Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and ConocoPhillips. The 2011 Democratic-backed proposal would have eliminated five tax breaks for the companies and generated an estimated $21 billion over a decade, according to the  Â New York Times.  The bill that came a year later would have eliminated $24 billion in tax subsidies from the five oil companies, according to the Boston Globe. Specifically,  the measures would have kept those five multinational oil companies from using these existing tax breaks : â¢ Deductions on taxes paid to foreign governments â¢ Deductions on domestic manufacturing costs â¢ Deductions for intangible drilling costs â¢ Percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells â¢ Deductions for qualified tertiary injectant expenses Three of these breaks applied specifically to the oil industry. The other two -- the ones about manufacturing costs and taxes paid to foreign governments -- can be claimed by businesses other than oil companies. If passed, these five provisions would still have applied to companies beyond the ""big five"" oil firms. In each of the two years, the proposal failed to advance in the U.S. Senate by margins of 52-48 in 2011 and 51-47 in 2012. The bills needed 60 votes in order to cut off debate and take a final vote. Ayotte joined most Republicans and a handful of Democrats from oil states to oppose the measure both times it hit the Senate floor. The billâs opponents sometimes cited a  March 2012 report  by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service that concluded withholding subsidies from companies could increase prices at the pump. In general the ad is correct that Ayotte sided with the position of ""big oil"" when she voted against advancing the bills. But the adâs wording is misleading. It states Ayotte ""voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."" Ayotte really voted against stripping the companies of tax breaks they already enjoyed. Meanwhile, Ayotteâs campaign pointed to several votes she has taken opposing tax credits for the oil and gas industry. One amendment, to a highway bill, would have repealed more than a dozen various tax credits including those for alternative fuel mixtures, certain plug-in vehicles, biodiesel and renewable diesel used as fuel and electricity produced from certain renewable resources. The amendment did not propose to repeal any of the tax breaks for the ""big five"" oil companies mentioned above, but it did target two credits dealing with oil -- one for producing oil and gas from marginal wells, and another for enhanced oil recovery. Neither was in effect when the amendment was offered and the marginal well credit hasnât been used since its creation in 2004, according to a 2013 article from lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP. Ayotte  was one of 26 senators who voted for the amendment.  It was opposed by a bipartisan group of 76 senators, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Ayotteâs campaign also pointed to a February amendment that would have phased out tax credits for fossil fuels on the same schedule as those for wind farms. The proposal , offered by Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, targeted many of the same existing tax breaks for ""big oil"" as the bills from 2011 and 2012. For example, it would have phased out deductions for intangible drilling costs and deductions on domestic manufacturing costs, among others. Ayotte joined most Democrats to vote for the amendment, which was  defeated 50 to 45.  Our Ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Kelly Ayotte ""voted to give big oil more than $20 billion in tax breaks."" In 2011 and 2012, Ayotte did indeed vote against measures that would have barred the biggest five oil companies from taking advantage of tax breaks they already enjoyed, which added up to more than $20 billion. But thatâs slightly different than what the ad says. Rather than vote to give the companies a new break, as the ad implies, Ayotte voted to support the status quo. Ayotteâs record is more complex, however, and she cast more recent votes that would have repealed some tax breaks for big oil. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate the adâs claim Mostly True.",10/7/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/07/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/ad-claims-kelly-ayotte-voted-billion-dollar-tax-br/,1,,

""Heâs somebody who when he ran said he promised he wouldnât vote to defund Planned Parenthood and since heâs been in office heâs done that four times,"" Deacon  told WRVO . She also made the claim in her victory speech in Juneâs primary election. The Syracuse area congressional district is considered a toss-up. Three Republicans and two Democrats have represented the district since 2003. Is Deacon right about Katkoâs record on Planned Parenthood funding? Katkoâs position on abortion Katko opposes abortion, except in cases of rape and incest, or if the health of the mother is at risk. He said during  one debate  in 2014 that he would reverse the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade if given the opportunity. That doesnât mean he opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Katko told the Post-Standard newspaper in Syracuse last year  he supported funding  until a  set of videos  was released that implied the organization was harvesting fetal tissue for sale. The creator of those videos has since  faced  charges related to the incident. Katko also went  on the radio  last September to explain why he changed his position. ""Itâs never an easy issue, right? Before, when I was running in the campaign, I was absolutely for funding for Planned Parenthood. The law is clear that any federal funds for Planned Parenthood canât be used for abortions, so thatâs not an issue,"" Katko told Grant Reeher  on WRVO . He went on to explain that the videos gave him pause to support federal funding for the organization. ""It isnât about abortion to me. Itâs about whether theyâre breaking the law or not,"" Katko said. The first and second votes The videos sparked state investigations into Planned Parenthood and a renewed effort to strip the organization of federal funding in Congress. In September 2015,  The Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015  was brought to the House Floor. Katko voted twice to advance the legislation. In his  first vote , Katko opposed a proposed amendment to reconsider the bill. His vote helped keep the legislation on the House floor. His  second  vote supported the actual bill, which passed in the House but was not brought to a vote in the Senate. The third vote Then during federal budget negotiations last year, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 was slipped into a  one-house resolution  to fund the federal government. It included the same language as the standalone bill. The House, with the  help of Katko , passed the resolution. The Senate did not. The fourth vote The fourth vote happened a few weeks later when Republicans in the House tried to defund the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Tucked away in  that legislation  was language that would have stripped federal funding to any entity that provided abortion services. Katko voted for the legislation. The House passed the measure, but the bill did not become law. Our ruling At the opening of Hillary Clintonâs regional campaign office in Syracuse, Deacon said Katko voted four times to defund Planned Parenthood. Sheâs right. Katko voted defund the organization, according to voting records.

"Says she ""voted for a statewide fracking ban.""",Dana Young mailer leaves out context of fracking bill.,"In an attempt to position herself as a more environmentally-friendly candidate, state Rep. Dana Young, R-Tampa, has sent mailers touting her vote for a recent bill targeting fracking. The effects of the legislation Young voted for are not as clear cut as the claim Young makes. A third-party group supporting Young, who is facing Democrat Bob Buesing for state Senate in the newly created District 18, sent theÂ mailer in the last weeks of September that says she ""voted for a statewide fracking ban to protect our water."" The group, the Florida Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, paid for the mailpiece, but the mailer says that Young approved the message. So we are putting Young on the Truth-O-Meter. The mailer refers to Youngâs vote on  House Bill 191 , legislation aimed at regulating fracking in Florida. We were curious about the Youngâs statement and the specifics of the measure.Â As we looked further into the bill, we found the mailer is somewhat misleading. What Young voted for would have regulated fracking, but it wouldnât have permanently banned it. A closer look at House Bill 191 HB 191, dubbed ""Regulation of Oil and Gas Resources,"" was sponsored by Rep. Ray Rodrigues, R-Estero, and passed 73 to 45 on Jan. 27 in the Florida House.Â Young voted in favor of this bill, along with 72 other Republicans, while 38 Democrats and 7 Republicans opposed the bill. Young reasoned that HB 191 could have been the first step to a permanent ban on fracking. However, the bill only called for a temporary moratorium on the process, not a ""ban"" like her mailer says. Democrats who voted against the bill echoed arguments of environmental groups and said a temporary ban doesnât go far enough to protect Floridaâs water. Had the bill passed (it  was defeated in a Florida Senate committee ), the measure would have allowed Florida to regulate fracking â a process that involves pumping large amounts of water, sand and chemicals into the ground to harness oil and gas reserves. Per the bill, fracking permits would not have been issued until a study was completed in 2017 by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP would have proposed rules based on the studyâs results, which would have been subject to approval of the Legislature. Point being, the bill was never intended to ban fracking permanently, but place a moratorium on the practice while its effects were studied. Democrats also took issue with the fact the bill would have prohibited Florida's counties and cities from passing local bans against fracking. According to the  Miami Herald , 41 cities and 27 counties oppose fracking. St. Petersburg has passed a resolution against hydraulic fracturing, along with Broward County, which  outlawed fracking in January . In addition, there were several amendments to HB191 offered up by Democrats that would have created more safeguards against fracking, including a  restriction on what chemicals can be used  and studies on  prenatal health , but they didnât pass. Young voted against some of these, but her spokesperson said those issues were unnecessary, trusting the DEP study would have addressed those concerns. Youngâs office said she strongly opposes fracking in Florida and will continue to seek a statewide ban. Our ruling A mailer from Young says she ""voted for a statewide ban on fracking."" That vote is in reference to HBÂ 191, which would have set up a temporary moratorium on fracking in anticipation of future regulations. The bill would have authorized a study on which to base further regulation. It was not an outright ban on fracking. Youngâs claim is partially accurate but is missing context that would give the reader a different impression. For that reason, we rate Youngâs statement Half True. Correction:  A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly reported who sent the mailer. The piece has been updated to reflect that it was sent by an outside committee with Young's approval. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ed07ec3c-17f2-456c-aded-b343caaff2b7",10/5/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/oct/05/dana-young/dana-young-mailer-leaves-out-context-fracking-bill/,1,,
"Says Rob Portman ""even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns.""",Ted Strickland's misleading claim about Portman voting to allow terrorists to buy guns.,"CORRECTION, 5:48p.m., September 29, 2016:  Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly described an amendment by Sen. Susan Collins. The story has been updated to reflect her as the author of that measure. Our rating on the claimÂ did not change. A new TV ad from Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland features a veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan who says he carried a gun ""so we wouldnât have to worry about terrorists using them here."" But Sen. Rob Portman, Stricklandâs Republican opponent, ""is blocking commonsense laws to stop terrorists and criminals from getting guns. Sen. Portman said no to background checks on all purchases,"" the adâs soldier continues. ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" That last statement caught our attention.Â  No, Portman did not vote to allow suspected terrorists to purchase guns. The attack obscures what really happened. The ad cites Senate voting records from June 20 and 23. First, weâll consult the record. Votes 106 and 109 were two of four votes on gun control measures considered by the Senate after the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since 9/11. On June 12, Omar Mateen, a man who had twice been investigated by the FBI for suspected terrorist ties, killed 49 people and wounded 53 at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla.. Vote 106 asked senators to vote to end the debate, or to keep debating, an amendment by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein which would authorize the U.S. attorney general to deny requests to sell firearms to ""known or suspected terrorists."" Portman voted ""nay,"" a vote against bringing the issue up for passage or failure. The week ahead of that vote, Portman  told reporters  in his weekly media conference call, ""I do believe that you should not be able to buy a weapon when youâre on the (terrorist) watch list."" Stricklandâs ad doesnât mention the other three votes taken that day, June 20, 2016, on the issue of suspected terrorists and gun sales. All four measures  failed , largely along party lines. Portman voted in favor of Republican Sen. Chuck Grassleyâs amendment to ""address gun violence and improve the availability of records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System."" He also voted in favor of Republican Sen. John Cornynâs proposal, an alternative to Feinsteinâs measure to prevent watchlisted terrorists from buying guns. The main difference between the Feinstein amendment and the one proposed by Cornyn had to do with due process -- granting an avenue for an individual to appeal if they are wrongfully listed as a terror suspect and denied a gun purchase. The Republican amendment allowed authorities to detain a terrorism suspect who tries to obtain a firearm, and gave a judge 72 hours to determine whether there was enough proof to bar the gun sale. Feinsteinâs amendment provided for an individual to appeal to the Justice Department if they felt they were wrongfully listed and barred from buying a gun. It did not have a three-day limit for the government to make its case. Republicans argued that Cornynâs amendment, with a stronger check-and-balance requiring a court order, was necessary in light of well-known errors on federal no-fly and terrorist watch lists. Former Sen. Ted Kennedy is  often cited  as an example after he was erroneously stopped for extra airport security checks because ""T. Kennedy"" was an alias used by a terror suspect. A motion to table a tweaked version of Feinsteinâs amendment, proposed by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of MaineÂ -- the  ""Vote 109 "" referenced by Stricklandâs ad -- failed on June 23 with a 46-52 vote, short of the 60 votes required to advance. Portman voted "" yea ,"" or against the amendment, in line with all but eight Republicans. Our ruling Stricklandâs campaign ad said of Portman, ""He even voted to allow people on the terrorism watch list to buy guns."" The ad distorts facts on many levels. People on the terrorism watch list couldÂ already buy guns before the votes in question. Portman voted along party lines on the gun control measures that came up for Senate vote on June 20 and 23. He voted against Feinsteinâs amendment to enact a blanket ban on firearm purchases by terrorists or suspected terrorists. But he voted for the Republican version of the legislation, sponsored by Cornyn, that would ban a gun sale after a three-day period of judicial review to determine whether an individual was on a watch list for legitimate reasons. The vote for Cornynâs legislation was literally a vote to stop terrorists from buying weapons â but the extra hurdles for the governmentÂ wereÂ not supported by Democrats.Â We rate the adâs claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/75c564aa-58eb-4640-9db2-99437d9cd9cd",9/29/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/29/ted-strickland/sen-rob-portman-voted-let-terrorists-buy-guns-nope/,1,,
"Says Miami Congressman Carlos ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore"" and ""repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change.""","Democrats mislead in attack on Carlos Curbelo's record on climate change, drilling.","While Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo portrays himself as an environmentalist, the Democratic Party says he is no treehugger and is aligned with Donald Trump. ""Republican Carlos Curbelo and Donald Trump's ideas about the environment are more alike than you think. Curbelo talks about protecting the environment,"" says a  TV ad  by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The ad then shows a clip of Curbelo talking about protecting the environment and then pivots to a clip of him on an oil rig. The narrator continues: ""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump, and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo represents a Democratic-leaning Westchester-to-Key West district. He faces a rematch Nov. 8 with former U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Miami. (Curbelo  does not support Trump  but said he  wonât  vote for Hillary Clinton, either.) We found that Curbelo supports current drilling but opposes an expansion near Floridaâs coasts. And while Curbelo has taken some votes related to pollution and climate change that Democrats criticize, he has been one of the more outspoken Republicans about combating climate change. Â  Trump on drilling Trump has generally spoken in favor of offshore oil drilling in recent months, although his position hasnât always been clear. He sounded skeptical about expanding offshore drilling in an interview with the  Tampa Bay Times  in February. ""They've already got plenty in the Gulf,"" Trump said. ""It would be a little bit of a shame (to expand drilling closer to Florida), because there's so much fracking, and there's so much oil that we have now that we never thought possible. That's an issue I'd absolutely study and do the right thing."" But Trump has been more forceful about his support for drilling since that time. ""Weâre going to revoke policies that impose unwarranted restrictions on new drilling technologies,"" he said in  North Dakota in May . In September, Trump said in a  fact sheet  that he will ""open up vast areas of our offshore energy resources for safe production"" and will eliminate ""unnecessary restrictions"" on offshore oil and gas. âCurbelo supports drilling offshoreâ While Curbelo defended current offshore oil drilling in 2015, he has fought against efforts to expand it closer to Florida than the current 125-mile restriction. Curbelo made a  video  of himself standing on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2015: ""The offshore oil industry in the United States fuels about 20 percent of our economy and assets like this are an important part of an all-of-the-above energy strategy that will grow the American economy and make our country more secure,"" he said. But Curbelo has voted three times in favor of Democratic amendments to protect coasts from drilling by  banning funds ,  research  or  testing . He also got the House to pass a bill to force companies that spill oil in foreign waters to clean up any damage to Florida coasts. âRepeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate changeâ The Democrats point to a handful of votes that Curbelo took that were contrary to Democratic efforts to fight pollution and climate change. In all four cases, Curbelo sided with Republicans in party line votes on legislation or a resolution. But the votes are cherry-picking Curbeloâs record, which also reflects his efforts to combat climate change and pollution. â¢Â In January Curbelo took a  stand  along with virtually all Republicans against a controversial proposal by the federal government to define which bodies of water fall under its jurisdiction. Curbelo thought the  ""Waters of the United States"" rule  was too vague and it was later stayed by the courts. â¢Â In 2015, Curbelo  voted in favor  of a bill Republicans said would prevent the EPA from using  ""secret science""  and require transparency. The EPA argued it already is transparent and uses sound science. â¢Â The only vote directly about climate change was minor. The House, along with Curbelo, barred funds for a  government climate model program  in 2015. Curbelo opposed it because he said it was duplicative, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said. â¢Â Curbelo also voted in favor of a  bill  to limit environmental reviews to move projects along in 2015. Importantly, the ad omits that Curbelo has been one of the leading Republican voices in Congress to come up with solutions to combat climate change. In September 2015, Curbelo signed onto a  congressional resolution  acknowledging climate changeâs existence and later, along with U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Fla., formed the bipartisan  Climate Solutions Caucus . ""It is vital for Congress to acknowledge the reality of climate change as a legitimate issue requiring feasible solutions, and we need leaders on both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will make a difference,"" Curbelo wrote in an op-ed in the  Miami Herald  Oct. 24, 2015. We found other actions that Curbelo took in an effort to fight pollution. In December 2015,  Curbelo was one of 10 Republicans  to vote against a resolution to nullify the EPAâs rules to  regulate carbon emissions  from new power plants. In July 2016, Curbelo  opposed  a vote by a  Florida commission  to increase allowed levels of toxins for over two dozen known chemicals in waterways. Â  Our ruling The DCCC said,""Curbelo supports drilling offshore just like Trump and Curbelo repeatedly voted against President Obama's ability to fight pollution and combat climate change."" Curbelo supports current drilling, but the ad omits that he has repeatedly voted against expanding drilling off Floridaâs coasts. Trump, though not always consistent, has sounded more favorable to drilling than Curbelo. Curbelo has taken votes against Democratic efforts to curb pollution and to model climate change, but that is cherry-picking his record. The ad omits that Curbelo has been a leader among Republicans speaking out about the need to combat climate change.

"Says MarcoÂ Rubio ""voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education.""",Unions attack Marco Rubio's education record.,"Two liberal labor unions say that Sen. Marco Rubioâs priorities are wrong for Floridians. A TV  ad  by AFSCME People and AFT Solidarity accuses Rubio of favoring cuts to Social Security and Medicare and also says he ""voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education."" AFSCME represents public sector workers while AFT stands for American Federation of Teachers -- both unions endorsed Rubioâs opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, in the U.S. Senate contest. The ad is airing in the Tampa and Orlando media markets. We have previously fact-checked similar claims about Rubioâs position on Social Security and Medicare cuts and found them  Half True . Here we will look at the education-related attacks that refer to his vote on the federal budget in 2011 and a statement he made on the presidential campaign trail in 2015. Education cuts The ad doesnât explain the timeframe for the cuts, but the fine print cites a 2011  article  by the liberal Center for American Progress. At the time, the Democrats and Republicans were in a budget stalemate about how to fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year. Thatâs a reference to H.R. 1, legislation to fund appropriations through the end of 2011 that passed the House but was rejected by the Senate in a  44-56 vote  on March 9, 2011. Rubio joined most of his Republican colleagues in voting in favor of it -- only three Republicans voted against it on the floor, and no Democrats voted for it. (Ultimately, the House, the Senate and the president agreed to a series of short-term ""continuing resolutions"" to keep the government going, rather than approving a more sweeping spending bill.) The legislation aimed to cut spending by about $57 billion -- including loads of cuts that had nothing to do with education. Republican leaders emphasized the broader aspects of the plan about reducing the size of government while Democrats emphasized the impact on education and disease research (the National Institutes of Health would also have been hit). Â  In a  statement  after the vote, Rubio said that he supported the Republican plan but said more time should be spent to overhaul entitlements: ""I supported this first step towards getting our fiscal house in order, but the truth is that America has reached a point where saving $57 billion is a mere drop in the bucket when compared to our $14 trillion debt. While reducing discretionary spending is an important goal, Washington is devoting a disproportionate amount of time to a tiny slice of the budget while ignoring the fact that continued inaction on saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is bankrupting our country."" Here are  some examples  of the education cuts: â¢ Title I education spending.  This is a  program  that sends federal funds to the states for K-12 education. H.R. 1 would have cut Title I spending by $693.5 million compared with the amount enacted for fiscal year 2010. â¢ Part B IDEA grants.  This  program  provides federal funding for special education based on a formula. H.R. 1 would have cut Part B spending by $557.7 million compared with the 2010 level. â¢ Pell grants.  This  program  funds low-income individuals pursuing undergraduate or sometimes graduate degrees. H.R. 1 would have capped the size of Pell grants for the 2011-12 award year at $4,015. Once that amount is adjusted for an additional sum provided under mandatory funding, the maximum level for Pell grants would be $845 lower than the 2011 level. â¢ Head Start.  This  program  provides low-income children of preschool age with child-development programs that teach skills that prepare them for school. H.R. 1 would have cut Head Start by a little under $1.1 billion. Education Department While campaigning for president in September 2015 in Carson City, Nev., Rubio  said  at a town hall, ""I honestly think we don't need an Education Department."" Rubio said that federal recommendations to state and local governments often turn into mandates tied to money. ""What starts out as a suggestion ends up being, âIf you want money from us, you must to do it this way,â and you will end up with a version of a national school board,"" Rubio said. Democrats noted that  Rubioâs college education  was paid for in part by Pell Grants and Stafford Loans, which are administered by the Education Department. But Rubio said that federal programs that have merit could be transferred to other agencies. Although he wants to get rid of the education department, he supports efforts to make  higher  education   affordable . Rubio also supports less federal involvement and more state and local control. For example, he introduced legislation that seeks to strengthen school choice for parents through a  tax credit  and he supports  Floridaâs tax credit scholarship program . Weâll note that Rubio has a lot of company among  Republicans   who   want  to eliminate the department. Such calls to ax the department are campaign rhetoric, said University of Iowa education professor David Bills. ""Reagan back in 1980 would have loved to eliminate the DOE,"" Bills said. ""I think it would be hard to find a major Republican now who doesnât want to at least radically shrink it. .... Â All of that kind of slowed down when Bush II came in with No Child Left Behind. I think Rubio is pretty representative."" Our ruling The TV ad by liberal groups says ""Rubio voted to slash school funding by billions of dollars and would eliminate the Department of Education."" Rubio, along with nearly all of his Republican Senate colleagues, voted for legislation in 2011 that would have cut about $57 billion in spending. The ad omits that this was across-the-board spending that didnât solely target education, and it failed to pass. While a presidential candidate in 2015, Rubio did advocate eliminating the U.S. Education Department. The ad omits that he said he would move worthwhile programs to other agencies.

"Says Marco Rubio voted ""against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.""",Patrick Murphy attacks Marco Rubio for voting against gun ban for people on no-fly list.,"When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio  unveiled a gun safety bill  Sept. 15, his Democratic rival for re-election attacked him for failing to support important gun safety legislation months earlier. ""After the tragedy in Orlando, Rubio used the deaths of 49 innocent Floridians to run for re-election while voting against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe,"" U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said in a  campaign statement . ""He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns."" Rubio, a Republican, has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association. Murphy has been endorsed by the Pride Fund to end Gun Violence, an LGBT group formed after the June 12 Orlando mass shooting at Pulse, a gay nightclub. Rubio voted for and against gun bills following the shooting, including those related to the no-fly list, a subset of the terrorist watch list. One vote was a procedural move against a Republican-sponsored compromise effort that failed. Gun safety bills in the Senate On June 20, the Senate voted on four amendments aimed to strengthen background checks and make it harder for terrorists or suspected terrorists to buy guns. All four were  rejected  largely on party lines. Rubio voted against the legislation written by Democrats â a background check amendment by Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and an amendment by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to ban  known or suspected terrorists  from buying a gun. He voted in favor of the Republican versions: a background check amendment by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley and an amendment about the terrorism watch list by Texas Sen. John Cornyn. Unlike Feinsteinâs bill, which would have placed a blanket ban on gun purchases by people who are terrorists or suspected terrorists, Cornynâs measure would have placed a three-day hold on such sales, allowing the government to make a case in court against the sale showing the person is involved in terrorism or will commit terrorism. Rubio  said he  supported Cornynâs legislation because it would ensure ""Second Amendment rights are not denied unless terrorism suspicions are adjudicated by a court, following actual notice and a hearing."" Murphy's campaign Â argues that Cornyn's bill requiring the federal government to show probable cause in courtÂ setsÂ an unworkable standard of proofÂ for law enforcement in court.Â  (Under  current law , being on a government terrorist watch list is not an automatic reason to be denied the right to buy a gun; however, the FBI is notified. There have to be other  disqualifying factors , such as a felony conviction or being an undocumented immigrant.) These were not the bills Murphy was talking about. Murphy was referring to a compromise crafted by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. Collinsâ  amendment  proposed to ban people from buying guns if they were on the no-fly list or the ""selectee list,"" which means they undergo additional screening before boarding a plane. Those who were banned from buying guns could appeal in court. The amendment had 12 cosponsors: seven Democrats, four Republicans and one independent. On June 23, a motion to table the legislation failed with a  46-52 vote . That left the amendment still pending, but it showed that her legislation was short of the 60 votes required to advance â and it never did. The question was a motion to table, so when Rubio voted ""yea"" he was voting against the amendment. Eight Republicans voted against tabling the legislation. Rubio  cosponsored  another Republican alternative from Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. That proposal would have also blocked those on a terrorist list from buying guns but delayed the sale for three days with the possibility of an extension to allow for an investigation. Then it required a hearing before a judge to block the person from buying a gun. It failed 67-31. A day before the vote on the Collins amendment, Rubio told reporters that it was a ""difficult balancing act"" to bar terrorists from getting guns while protecting constitutional rights. ""Theyâre trying to do it all in a hurry here, and I think we need to get it right,"" he  said . After the vote, Rubio told  CNN  that he was concerned about how much money a gun buyer would have to spend on an appeal. ""If you erroneously end up on a no-fly list, or a selectee list, unless you can come up with $10,000 or $15,000 to hire a lawyer, even if you get your fees back upfront, itâs going to be hard and intimidating to go to a federal court,"" he said. On Sept. 15, Rubio unveiled his  own bill  that would allow the U.S. attorney general to delay a firearms' purchase for up to three days and file an emergency court petition if someone previously investigated for terrorism tried to buy a gun. The Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, had previously been placed on a terrorist watch list in 2013 and was investigated by the FBI but he was never charged and later removed from the list. After the gun legislation in the Senate died in June, the House didnât take the bills up for a vote. Murphy cosponsored a  bill  requiring the FBI be notified when individuals under a terrorism investigation and those formerly under investigation purchase firearms or explosives. U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., introduced a similar version in the  Senate , but neither bill has reached a vote. Was Collinsâ amendment bipartisan? Murphy called Collinsâ amendment bipartisan, and in many ways it seems as though it was: It was written by a Republican, drew four Republican cosponsors along with seven Democrats, and attracted eight GOP membersâ support in the procedural vote against tabling it. The U.S. Senate has 54 Republicans and 45 Democrats (including one independent, Bernie Sanders, who pursued the Democratic presidential nomination). There is no pure definition of what can be called a ""bipartisan"" piece of legislation but you know it when you see it, said David Hawkings, senior editor of CQ Roll Call, a publication that tracks votes and legislation. ""Itâs an evolving definition -- as Congress gets more and more polarized on party lines even a handful crossing going against the grain makes it bipartisan,"" he said. ""Itâs situational."" Hawkings said he would consider Collinsâ amendment bipartisan. ""In that case it was an effort by Collins, obviously a Republican, who was trying to put together enough Republicans to go against the wishes of their own leadership and go with Democrats to advance this,"" he said. Laurel Harbridge, a political scientist at Northwestern University who recently wrote a  book about bipartisanship , says that a bill is ""bipartisan"" if at least 20 percent of a bill's cosponsors hail from the opposite party as the sponsor. So Collinsâ amendment would meet that definition. ""In today's polarized Congress any measure that picks up any support from the other side of the aisle might be deemed bipartisan -- especially on a particularly salient and charged issue like gun control,"" George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder said. Our ruling Murphy saidÂ Rubio voted ""against every bill that would have helped keep our families safe. He even voted against a bipartisan measure, introduced by a Republican, to prevent people on the no-fly list from purchasing guns.""

"Says Russ Feingold was the ""only senator to vote against Homeland Security.""",PAC wrongly claims Russ Feingold was only vote against Homeland Security Department.,"A TV ad from  Let America Work , a single-candidate super PAC that supports Wisconsin Republican  Ron Johnson  for re-election, paints Democratic challenger  Russ Feingold  as someone who weakened the military during his 18 years in the Senate. Feingold, the narrator states, ""voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times"" -- a claim Johnson made that we  rated Half True . Feingold did vote 11 times against an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that it takes appropriations bills to provide funding. And lawmakers sometimes oppose the annual measure because of policy provisions included in it.   The ad , released Sept. 1, 2016, continues with words on the screen that say Feingold was the ""only senator to vote against military intelligence"" and the ""only senator to vote against Homeland Security."" The two claims are essentially fleshed out by the narrator saying: ""Feingold voted against the Patriot Act and against creating the Department of Homeland Security."" Feingold is well known for casting the lone vote against the  USA Patriot Act , the 2001 anti-terrorism law introduced by U.S. Rep.  Jim Sensenbrenner , R-Wis., in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, in his rematch with Johnson, Feingold has done  a fundraising appeal  explaining his vote. But did Feingold cast the only vote against creating the Department of Homeland Security? No. As reported  by the New York Times at the time, the Senate voted in 2002 to ""reorganize broad elements of a scattered federal government around a focused response to terrorism,"" with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security being ""Washington's biggest transformation in 50 years."" ""Not since Congress and the Truman administration upended the nationâs military apparatus to fight the cold war in 1947 has the government been reshaped so dramatically around a single purpose,"" the Times said. The department ""will slowly begin to absorb 22 of Washington's signature functions, including immigration, border protection, emergency management, intelligence analysis and the protection of the president himself."" The  roll call vote  on the Homeland Security Act shows the measure passed 90-9. Feingold was one of the nine, along with fellow Democrats Daniel Akaka of Alaska, Robert Byrd of West Virginia, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Carl Levin of Michigan and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland. (James Jeffords, a Vermont independent, also voted no, while Frank Murkowski of Alaska was not present. Wisconsin Democrat Herb Kohl voted yes.) Feingoldâs campaign responded to the ad the same day, issuing  a statement saying  Feingold voted no because the bill contained ""unrelated riders."" The statement included this excerpt from his book, ""While America Sleeps"": Using the same tactics as the drafters of the Patriot Act, the backers knew they could grab a victory on some unrelated agenda because the overall bill was what was known in Washington as a must-pass. Such bills, which Congress has almost no choice but to pass, often attract riders like the one that restricted employeesâ rights. The Bush administration and the Republicans in the Senate, hungry to regain the majority, pounced with some gusto on the political opportunities this new climate of fear provided. Let America Work didnât respond to our requests for information. Our rating Let America Work says Feingold was the ""only senator to vote against Homeland Security."" Feingold was one of nine senators who voted against the 2002 law that created the Department of Homeland Security.

"Says ""Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika.""","Patrick Murphy has voted against 'every' Zika funding bill, Marco Rubio says.","While the Senate bickers over Zika funding, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubioâs campaign says Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has been playing partisan politics over the issue in the House. The same day the Senate failed to approve emergency public health funding to deal with Zika for the third time in three months, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said Murphy has been an obstructionist. ""Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika,"" she said on  Sept. 7, 2016 . (By ""only,"" she meant the only general election Senate candidate, comparing Murphy to Rubio.) That doesnât sound like the position a Florida congressman facing a Zika outbreak would take in an election year, so we checked the record. We should note Rubio has supported high-level funding for Zika efforts, even  co-sponsoring a bill with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson . Perez-Cubas was speaking for Rubio, so we are putting Rubio on the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out Murphy has opposed plenty of Republican-backed funding proposals, but ""every"" is putting it too strong. He still has voted forÂ some measures. Funding malaise President Barack Obama first asked Congress for $1.89 billion in funding in February 2016 to deal with a potential outbreak of Zika. The virus has been linked to cases of infant microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so  focus has been on prevention . There are  at least 771 cases of Zika in Florida , including several local transmissions in the Miami area. But  that count may not always be the most accurate . Murphy has been involved with other Zika-related bills, including acting as a cosponsor for a Democrat-favored measure ( HR 5044 ) that provided the full amount Obama requested. Those bills have not left committees in the House. A deeply partisan Congress, meanwhile, has fought all year over finding the money for mosquito control, vaccine development, diagnosing the disease, public education campaigns and more. There have been several measures introduced to deal with the disease, but the main focus this summer has been on some legislative wrangling over appropriations bills. House Republicans on May 18 passed a measure ( HR 5243 ) that would have provided $622 million for Zika. With Obama  threatening to veto the measure , Murphy voted no on that one with other Democrats. It was not taken up in the Senate. The next day, Murphy voted yes for a bill ( HR 4974 ) that would have allowed the White House to repurpose leftover funding to deal with the 2014 Ebola outbreak and use it for Zika. Rubioâs campaign said this bill didnât count, because there was no specified dollar amount, and didnât guarantee the money would be used for Zika, only that it could. But thatâs splitting hairs, because HR 4974 still would have provided at least one option to fund Zika-related programs. Now itâs time for a civics lesson, because what the House did next wasnât covered on  Schoolhouse Rock . The House then passed another bill ( HR 2557 ) that was  originally about funding for transportation and other agencies . Instead, the bill became a vehicle for Zika funding using language from HR 5243, the Republican measure. The House wanted $622 million for Zika, but cut that money from other programs in order to stay budget-neutral, a process known as recission. The House also added provisions  restricting contraception services  that Democrats opposed. The Senate wanted $1.1 billion in new funding. The bill went to conference in June to  iron out differences . The House agreed to $1.1 billion in funding, as long as about $700 million was found through cutting other areas. Murphy voted against  final passage  of HR 2577, and  against adopting  the conference report instituting the changes. The Senate is currently battling over the bill. Senate Democrats have so far  blocked a vote three times in three months , wanting a ""clean"" bill with no contraception provisions and the full $1.89 billion originally requested. Thatâs not the end of the line, however. On June 16, Murphy voted for  HR 5293 , a bill that would allow the administration to shift money in the Defense Department to help with Zika efforts through that agency. Again, there was no set dollar amount or guarantee thatâs how the money would be used, but it was another option in the Zika toolbox. It passed the House but is stuck in the Senate. ""Murphy did vote in favor of two efforts to transfer funds in support of Zika efforts and opposed the major effort in hopes of gaining more funding than the Republicans offered,"" said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political science professor. Our ruling Rubio, through a spokeswoman, said, ""Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika."" Murphy, like most congressional Democrats, has opposed Republican-led efforts to conditionally fund anti-Zika efforts at less than what Obama has requested. But he has offered other solutions and voted against his party for two bills that would have allowed unspecified amounts of money to be repurposed for Zika programs. So the campaign was wrong to say he voted against ""every"" measure.Â We rate Rubioâs statement False.",9/14/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/14/marco-rubio/patrick-murphy-has-voted-against-every-zika-fundin/,1,,
"Nevada Republican Senate nominee ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims.""",Planned Parenthood Votes says Joe Heck 'voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims'.,"An affiliate of Planned Parenthood has  released an ad  targeting Rep. Joe Heck, the Republican nominee in the neck-and-neck U.S. Senate race in Nevada. Accompanying a series of black-and-white images of women, a narrator says, ""Itâs terrible, but itâs true. Joe Heck voted eight times to defund Planned Parenthood and would criminalize abortion for rape victims, because heâs a Washington politician before heâs a Nevada physician. And Planned Parenthood wants you to know that Joe Heck is dangerous to your health."" Heck is running against Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto in the open-seat race to succeed retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. We took a closer look at the part about criminalizing abortion, which was punctuated with text on the screen saying, ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims."" (We've already looked at Heck's record on  voting to defund Planned Parenthood .) The idea of criminally punishing women for having an abortion has already come up in the 2016 campaign,  as weâve noted before  -- and when it did, Republicans quickly backed off it. In an  interview with MSNBCâs Chris Matthews on March 30, 2016 , Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said women should be punished for having an abortion, but he quickly backtracked after an outcry, releasing a  statement on his campaign website later that day . We found that thereâs some truth behind the adâs charge, but the Planned Parenthood Votes ad overplays its hand. In small type on screen, the ad cites  media coverage  of a 2012 bill that Heck  co-sponsored  and  voted for  Â -- the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. (Planned Parenthood Votes confirmed in interviews that this was the legislation the ad was based on.) On July 31, 2012, the bill secured 220 yea votes and 154 nay votes in the Republican-controlled House. While that was a majority of the chamber, it did not pass because it did not reach the two-thirds minimum required for that type of vote. According to the  bill summary , the measure would have amended the federal criminal code to ""prohibit any person from performing or attempting to perform an abortion"" after 20 weeks within the District of Columbia ""except in conformity with this act's requirements."" The  exceptions , according to the bill text, would be risk of ""the death of the pregnant woman; or ... the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman."" In other words, pregnancy through rape would not qualify for an exception under the bill. And the possible penalty could include a fine and up to two years in prison. But a key question is: AÂ penalty for who? The answer is that the criminal risk would fall upon the doctor. In fact, the legislation includes language that specifically protects the woman getting the abortion from being prosecuted: ""A woman upon whom an abortion in violation of (this legislation) is performed or attempted may not be prosecuted under, or for a conspiracy to violate"" the measure. However, the Planned Parenthood ad fuzzes the difference between prosecuting the abortion provider and prosecuting the woman receiving the abortion. The use of ""for"" in the sentence ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims"" could be interpreted to mean that rape victims would bear the legal consequences, even though the law makes clear that they would not. In fact, the ad visually reinforces the notion that women would be left open to criminal penalties by featuring a succession of young women, none of whom wear the tools of the medical profession, such as a lab coat or a stethoscope. Planned Parenthood Votes said that even without criminal penalties for women, the bill would have had severe consequences for them, effectively making it impossible for rape victims to receive an abortion after 20 weeks. ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion,"" said Erica Sackin, communications director for Planned Parenthood Votes. ""Whether the law sends women to jail or doctors to jail, the end result is the same: Women would have been left with nowhere to turn to for safe, legal abortion."" Our ruling The Planned Parenthood Votes ad said that ""Joe Heck voted to criminalize abortion for rape victims."" The group has a point that a bill Heck voted for and co-sponsored would have criminalized medical professionals from performing abortions after 20 weeks for rape victims who are not at risk of death or significant physical health complications due to pregnancy, at least in Washington, D.C. This would have eliminated all legal abortions for women in that category. However, the ad blurs the issue of whether medical professionals or the women themselves would be at risk of prosecution. Only medical professionals would face legal consequences under the bill, but the adâs imagery implies otherwise, using only women as visuals. On balance, we rate the ad Half True.",9/13/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/13/planned-parenthood-votes/planned-parenthood-votes-says-joe-heck-voted-crimi/,1,,
"""Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika).""",NARAL misleads in attack on Marco Rubio about Zika funding.,"As the number of Floridians infected with the Zika virus continues to escalate, political groups and and candidates have lobbed attacks in the U.S. Senate battle in Florida. NARAL Pro-Choice America, a liberal organization that supports abortion rights, attacked Republican U.S. Sen. Marco Rubioâs record on Zika in an  ad  airing on TV in Orlando and West Palm Beach and online. NARAL endorsed Rubioâs opponent, U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter. ""The Zika virus is here. Itâs dangerous to pregnant women. And it has no cure. But Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency,"" states the narrator while text states that Rubio ""voted against contraception and family planning."" The narrator then continues: ""And Marco Rubio continues to be against a woman's right to choose an abortion even if they are infected with the Zika virus."" The ad shows video of someone clad in protective gear spraying for mosquitoes and anxious looking women including one who is pregnant. The ad began airing as  Congress  returned from recess to debate Zika funding again. On Sept. 6, a Senate bill failed to receive the necessary votes to move forward. We will zero in on Rubioâs votes related to Zika. Rubioâs voting record and public statements about Zika show that he has repeatedly shown support for Zika funding requests, including by President Barack Obama. The ad is referring to Rubioâs votes in favor of Zika legislation that would have cut funding to one organization in Puerto Rico, an affiliate of Planned Parenthood. Zika bills In February, Obama requested $1.9 billion for vaccine research, testing and mosquito control related to Zika. Rubio  announced his support  for Obamaâs request at a press conference in Miami April 8. A timeline from Rubioâs office states he was the first congressional Republican to announce his support. Since that time, Rubio has repeatedly called on his colleagues in  floor   speeches ,  media  outlets and  press conferences  to pass a bill. On May 12, Rubio and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, announced they would introduce legislation to provide the full $1.9 billion request. ""There's no reason every proposal to address Zika cannot be bipartisan and earn broad support, and I'm hopeful we can reach a final outcome that fully addresses the problem,"" Rubio said at the time. On May 17, Rubio voted with the majority, 68-29, for a motion on an  amendment  by Â Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.,Â and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., to provide $1.1 billion to combat Zika. Rubio  reluctantly Â voted for the compromise measure while still calling for Obamaâs full funding request. Two days later, the Senate passed the full bill  89-8  with Rubio voting with the majority. The bill called for spending $1.1 billion to prevent, prepare and respond to the Zika virus domestically and internationally including on the development of a vaccine. House and Senate negotiators then got together in a conference committee. Republicans added a clause to block any money for Profamilias, the Puerto Rican branch of Planned Parenthood. The services of that family planning agency are relevant here because Zika can be transmitted through sex, and condoms can reduce the chance of getting Zika. Profamilias served 8,000 people in 2015. Democrats saw that as a ""poison pill"" intended to doom the bill, while Republicans said Democrats were refusing to compromise. While the bill would have blocked funding for Profamilias, it would not have blocked funding for Puerto Rico entirely. The ad omits that the bill provided funds that would potentially help clinics and hospitals in nearly every municipality on the island. Puerto Rico has 20 community health centers operating at 84 sites. Profamilias has seven clinics on the island, and in each area there is another type of facility that would have been eligible for Zika funding. The ad cites two Rubio votes in June on the  appropriations bill  that included the $1.1 billion for Zika. The first vote, on June 14, was a motion to proceed and passed  94-3 . So NARAL is attacking Rubio for voting in favor of something that was supported by virtually every senator of both parties. The second vote was on June 28 when the Senate voted  52-48  to bring up the Zika measure. It failed to reach the 60-vote threshold, so the underlying bill didnât reach an up or down vote. Rubio voted for the measure. ""Shame on Washington for failing to pass Zika funding,"" Rubio said after the bill died. ""Weâve been on top of this issue for five months, and itâs a failure of both parties in this town, including the president of the United States, that itâs taken this long to even get to this point."" One final note about the adâs attack on Rubio for opposing abortion, including for women with Zika. Rubio told  Politico  in August: ""I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life."" Our ruling NARALâs TV ad said, ""Marco Rubio voted against funding health clinics that provide critical care during this public health emergency (Zika)."" The text on the screen stated that Rubio ""voted against contraception and family planning."" The ad creates a misleading impression that Rubioâs votes show he is indifferent to funding clinics to combat Zika. Actually, he has repeatedly supported Zika funding requests, including $1.9 billion sought by Obama. The ad cherry-picks votes by zeroing in on Rubioâs votes on measures that would have blocked funding to the Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico. The ad doesnât explain that despite that block, the bill still could have provided money to fight Zika both in Puerto Rico and the United States. Nothing passed due to the gridlock over that issue. As for the statement about Rubioâs voting record, we rate it Mostly False.",9/8/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/08/naral-pro-choice/naral-misleads-attack-marco-rubio-about-zika-fundi/,1,,
"""I cast the deciding vote extending Medicaid health care coverage to 50,000 of our fellow citizens,""",Was Colin Van Ostern the deciding vote for Medicaid expansion in NH?,"New Hampshireâs next governor will have a say in whether the state continues its Medicaid expansion program, which covers nearly 50,000 low-income residents and is set to expire in 2018. Executive Councilor Colin Van Ostern pledges to support the program, and touts his background on the subject as proof. ""As a member of the Executive Council, I cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people,"" Van Ostern wrote in a mailer sent to voters recently, a point he has repeated on the campaign trail. ""I cast the deciding vote extending Medicaid health care coverage to 50,000 of our fellow citizens,"" Van Ostern said in a WMUR debate the week before the primary. Was Van Ostern the programâs savior? We decided to take a look. New Hampshireâs Legislature approved a bill in 2014 to expand Medicaid for roughly two years to cover low-income adults making less than 138 percent of the poverty level. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan signed the expansion, also known as New Hampshire Health Protection Program, into law that March. As an Executive Councilor, Van Ostern had no participation in that pivotal vote. Many credited Republican leaders in the House and Senate for the vote because a few broke from their party and sided with Democrats in favor of expansion. The Executive Council had a say on the program later that year, when the Department of Health and Human Services brought forward a  $292 million contract amendment to pay for and implement expanded Medicaid. The five-member council is in charge of approving state agency contracts that exceed $25,000. The council in 2014 was made up of three Democrats and two Republicans. Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan, who presides over the council, urged members to pass the agreement. When she called the roll,  all three Democrats voted by voice vote for the contract. The two Republicans opposed it. Was Van Ostern the deciding vote? Not really. Campaign spokesman Matt Trojan said without Van Osternâs support, Medicaid expansion wouldnât have passed. But thatâs not entirely accurate. The councilâs vote was on a contract that allowed the two health care providers to move forward with the program that had already been approved in law. At the time, Van Ostern himself said it was already a done-deal. ""There are legitimate policy disagreements, but this has been decided. This has been through the legislative process,""  Van Ostern said . Â  And the ""deciding vote"" argument is even more dubious. The claim has typically been used as an attack against Democrats who voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act, including  New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen . In that case all 60 Democratic votes -- including Shaheenâs -- were needed to pass the measure through the Senate. However, Shaheen, unlike others, was hardly a holdout until the last minute; she gave indications early on that she supported the presidentâs reform plan. Those claims were typically rated  Mostly False . Â  By the same token, the other two Democrats on the Executive Council have equal claim to the deciding vote title. Generally, calling someone ""the deciding vote"" implies he or she played a pivotal role, such as withholding support or opposition until the last moment. Expanded Medicaid received strong support among Democrats, and as the councilâs controlling party, the contract wasnât expected to fail. Before the vote, Van Ostern and another Democrat both stated they planned to support the agreement. Our ruling Executive Councilor and candidate for governor Colin Van Ostern said he ""cast the deciding vote to extend Medicaid coverage to 50,000 people."" The Executive Council voted in favor of the contract that allowed expanded Medicaid to go forward, but the vote to approve the program already passed the legislature with bipartisan support. Van Ostern was one of three Democrats who voted for the contract and stated his support ahead of time. Since he did not have a direct vote on the law, and didnât change his position, we rate his claim Mostly False.",9/8/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/08/colin-van-ostern/was-colin-van-ostern-deciding-vote-medicaid-expans/,1,,
"Says ""Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood ... and Heck opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk.""",Catherine Cortez Masto largely correct about Joe Heck's votes to defund Planned Parenthood.,"Republican Rep. Joe Heckâs record on abortion is fast becoming the subject of many salvos in the unending television ad wars in Nevadaâs competitive Senate race. Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto has run several ads attacking Heck on the issue, most recently one featuring a Las Vegas-area gynecologic oncologist who opposes Heck because he voted to strip funding for Planned Parenthood. ""Joe Heck voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood, which thousands of women depend on for cancer screenings,"" she says  in the ad . ""And Heck opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Heck is  no stranger to ads  attacking his stance on abortion, as Democrats have sought to highlight the Republican military doctorâs adamant anti-abortion stance in both his  current Senate race  and  past congressional races . A review of Heckâs voting record and public statements over the past six years shows that Cortez Mastoâs ad is largely accurate, though over-simplified. Ten votes? Heck himself freely  admits  he voted to defund Planned Parenthood, and his voting record since entering Congress in 2010 reflects that position. Itâs more difficult to argue that Heck has voted 10 separate times to defund the program, as that number relies on counting several procedural motions that werenât strict up-or-down votes on funding for Planned Parenthood. For example, the ad cites five votes taken by Heck in September 2015 to  ""shut down the government over Planned Parenthood ,"" but not all of them are the same, including: Two procedural votes on Sept. 17 to  end debate  and  adopt rules  for floor consideration on a measure defunding Planned Parenthood. A  Sept. 18 vote  on a bill (Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015) barring federal funding to the organization for one year and redirecting the funding to community health centers. A  Sept. 30 procedural vote  allowing for floor consideration of continuing resolution to fund the government that would also defund Planned Parenthood, and a  subsequent vote  on that bill itself. All of the votes mentioned in the ad were taken as part of a legislative attempt to strip funding from the program, but they arenât all strict up-or-down votes. Of the five votes listed above, two are actual roll call votes on barring federal funding the program, while the other three are procedural votes that certainly moved the legislation forward but, again, arenât direct votes on the bill. Cortez Masto spokesman Zach Hudson said the campaign referenced every vote listed in Congressional Quarterly that references defunding Planned Parenthood. Heck campaign spokesman Brian Baluta told PolitiFact that counting procedural votes unfairly inflates the number. The other votes mentioned in the ad are a mix of procedural and more straightforward votes to defund the program. The ad cites three votes related to the same piece of 2015 defunding legislation, including the  initial House vote , a  reconciliation vote  agreeing to changes made by the Senate, and a  veto override  vote. And it cites  two   votes  on amending 2011 spending bills clearly designed to bar federal funding from the organization. Our friends at  PolitiFact New Hampshire  took similar issue with a claim about endangered Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte voting to defund the group  six times , ruling that counting procedural votes is ""accurate but needs clarification."" Health exemptions The second part of the ad claims that Heck opposes ""a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Generally, Heck opposes abortion. His campaign said he supports exemptions in cases of rape, incest and if the pregnancy threatens a motherâs life. The Cortez Masto campaign argues, however, that Heck opposes abortion even when the motherâs health is ""at risk."" There is a difference between situations where continuing a pregnancy threatens the life of the mother and pregnancies with serious future health concerns for the mother. Cortez Mastoâs campaign pointed PolitiFact to a  2008 Newsweek  article detailing the health exemption, in part citing a Supreme Court ruling in  Doe v. Bolton  that says health can be defined as medical judgment on factors including ""physical, emotional, psychological, familial and the woman's age."" The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL), a pro-abortion rights group, provides several examples in a  2016 fact sheet  of women whose pregnancies, while not life-threatening, would endanger their future ability to have children or seriously harm the mother if the pregnancy was brought to term. The ad cites as evidence  Heck voting for  a measure banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with  exemptions for abortions  necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman ""in reasonable medical judgment,"" and limited cases of rape and incest. Heck  voted against  a Democrat-led ""motion to recommit"" the bill that sought to add an exception to the 20-week ban by allowing abortions that would preserve the health of the mother. Â  Our ruling A Catherine Cortez Masto campaign ad claims Joe Heck ""voted 10 times to defund Planned Parenthood,"" and ""opposes a woman's right to choose, even when her health is at risk."" Heck has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, a fact he publicly admits. The harder question to answer is whether to count procedural votes leading up to formal votes on the defunding measures as votes to defund the group. The ad is mostly accurate, but needs some clarification on the actual number of votes. We rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab6a58e3-8036-4024-b176-c218b2187d5b",9/6/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/sep/06/catherine-cortez-masto/catherine-cortez-masto-largely-right-say-opponent-/,1,,
"Says U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin voted to ""force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs.""",PAC ad say Bruce Poliquin voted to force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs.,"The political action committee End Citizens United has launched a multi-pronged attack ad against Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, accusing the businessman of making health care more costly for older Americans. In a 30-second television  commercial , the PAC says Poliquin voted for a Medicare proposal that would ""force seniors to pay thousands more."" ""Heâd even force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs,"" the ad says. Poliquin's office objected to the ad, saying in a news release, ""Congressman Poliquin has been working to get prescription drug prices down, not up. Thatâs why he strongly supported Medicare coverage for prescription drugs for our seniors."" Who's right here? Both sides are spinning the truth. End Citizens United spokesman Adam Bozzi  says  the claim is a reference to Poliquin's March 25, 2015, vote for a Republican budget that  called for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare. The measure passed the House, but it had no shot of passing the Senate and surviving the veto of President Barack Obama Obama. The language of the ad itselfÂ if difficult to understand.Â We watched the ad several times and werenât entirely sure if the ad said, ""Heâd even force seniors to pay â¦"" or ""He even forced seniors to pay â¦"" Â The wording difference might mislead voters as to what Poliquin did or hoped to do. Either way, End Citizens United says a vote to repeal Obamacare is a vote to force seniors to pay more for drugs because repealing Obamacare would eliminate a fix to Medicare Part D known as the prescription drug  doughnut hole . Here's what theyâre talking about. In 2010, seniors had to pay full price for the first $310 worth of prescription drugs purchased. Between $310 and $2,830, insurance kicked in and Medicare paid 75 percent of the cost. But once the bill exceeded $2,830, seniors had to pay the full price of their drugs until the annual bill reached $4,550 (the doughnut hole). Then catastrophic insurance kicked in and insurance covered 95 percent of the cost. So the ""hole"" was the $1,720 gap between $2,830 and $4,550. In 2006, 4 million seniors ended up paying full price for some of their prescriptions because of the gap. The health care law, passed in 2010, sought to shrink and eliminate that gap in coverage. The gap is in the process of being phased out and will close completely in 2020. But even closing it gradually, combined with other features of Obamacare saved nearly 10.7 million seniors more than $20 billion on drug costs, according to  a February 2016 estimate  by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That's nearly $2,000 per senior since the law was enacted. Repealing Obamacare  would cost seniors in other ways , as we outlined two years ago. Poliquinâs campaign argued that Poliquin actually voted against an attempt to repeal Obamacare in FebruaryÂ 2015, because there was no plan to replace it. He voted for repeal the following month because the Republican budget had a better plan that would have kept traditional Medicare ""as a plan option"" for people in or near retirement but  privatized part of the program . There was another vote on repealing Obamacare on  Jan. 6, 2016 . Poliquin voted in favor of it. His spokesman, Michael Byerly, said that wasn't really a vote to repeal ""as it technically only repealed the harmful taxes and provisions that have caused prices to go up."" But sponsor Rep.Â Tom Price, R-Georgia, opened debate on the measure by saying, ""For the first time since the law was enacted, Congress is one vote away from sending a broad repeal of Obamacare to the presidentâs desk."" Byerly, Poliquin's spokesman, also argued that prescription drug prices have gone up because of Obamacare itself, referring us to a 2010 letter from the Congressional Budget Office predicting a 1 percent increase for established drugs. Democrats, in turn, have argued that Obamacare has kept health costs lower than they would have been without the legislation. As we've reported in the past, such arguments are  debatable . To sum it up, Poliquin never voted to raise drug prices directly. He voted to repeal the health care law -- a show vote that could have resulted in drug prices going up for Medicare recipients. Our ruling End Citizens United's ad says Poliquin voted to ""force seniors to pay more for prescription drugs."" It gives the misleading impression that he voted on that specific issue when, in fact, he was voting to repeal the 2010Â health care law. If the repeal bill had become law â it didnât â it would have removed provisions phasing out a prescription drug doughnut hole for Medicare recipients.Â  End Citizens Unitedâs claim is partiallyÂ accurate but takes things out of context. We rate it HalfÂ True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6836d2fa-255e-4ec2-a0f7-06edd8243e2a",8/30/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/30/end-citizens-united/pac-ad-say-bruce-poliquin-voted-force-seniors-pay-/,1,,
"Says Hillary Clinton ""voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500.""",Republican Party of Florida Facebook post misses the mark in Clinton attack.,"Hillary Clinton has made it clear on  multiple occasions  she doesnât want to raise taxes on the middle class, but the Republican Party of Florida said she once voted to do just that. The party posted an  image  on its Facebook page that says Clinton ""voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500."" Â  Is Clinton guilty of double speak? What we found is the truth was far more nuanced than the what the image claims. Clintonâs 2008 budget vote  We never heard back from the Republican Party of Florida for evidence of this claim, but we did find the  likely explanation  from the Republican National Committee, which made a similar claim Â Aug. 17, 2016. The GOP cites a March 14, 2008, vote, when Clinton joined Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Olympia Snow of Maine, in voting for  Senate Continuing Resolution 70 . The measure passed 51-44. Continuing Resolution 70 set the framework for the 2008-09 federal budget. It crafted a $3 trillion roadmap for lawmakers to follow in building the next yearâs federal budget. It also created revenue markers for future years, so lawmakers could begin to contemplate how the budget picture may look down the road. If this reads like a mushy description, it is. As the  New York Times  put it at the time, the resolution -- and the companion passed in the House ""are nonbinding and represent no formal action on either spending or taxes."" Literally speaking, Clintonâs vote did nothing. (""Congress engages in $3 trillion political act,"" read the headline in the  International Herald Tribune .) So how do Republicans claim CR 70 is evidence she voted to raise taxes on the middle class? Among the measures contained in CR 70 were revenue projections that assumed a number of temporary tax cuts signed by President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003 would expire at the end of 2010. The resolution endorsed extending $340 billion worth of the tax cuts, the Associated Press reported at the time, but ""balked at continuing all of them."" Among the projected revenue changes that Clinton voted for, one would have raised the 25 percent tax bracket back to its pre-2001 level of 28 percent. At theÂ time of the vote, that  25 percent tax bracket  started at $32,551 for single filers and went up to $78,850. Because of  deductions  people are allowed to claim, someone would need to make $41,500 a year to fall into the 25 percent tax bracket. A misleading attack There are several problems with this claim, however. Clintonâs vote was nonbinding. As we already mentioned, the vote didnât affect peopleâs pocketbooks. CR 70 had no binding impact on the tax policy in the United States in 2008, 2009 or any year after that. The Bush tax cuts werenât set to expire until the end of 2010. Clinton and everyone else knew that the Bush-era tax cuts wouldnât expire until the end of 2010, when a new Congress and president would be in office. That means a different set of lawmakers would ultimately decide the fate of the tax cuts. In fact, it was a key point during the 2008 presidential election. Clinton the candidate wanted to extend the Bush-era cuts for people making less than $250,000 a year. Clinton, who was still seeking the Democratic nomination at the time of the vote, had promised to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for most Americans. ""I am absolutely committed to not raising a single tax on middle- class Americans, people making less than $250,000 a year,""  Clinton said at an ABC News debate in April 2008 , a month after her vote on CR 70. ""In fact, I have a very specific plan of $100 billion in tax cuts that would go to help people afford health care, security retirement plans, you know, make it possible for people to get long-term care insurance and care for their parents and grandparents who they are trying to support, making college affordable and so much else."" Many of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were always scheduled to expire. From their initial passage, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts had a sunset provision. Again, in a literal sense, no vote was necessary to roll back many of the tax-cutting provisions. The laws were crafted to do that without any vote. William Gale, an economist at the Tax Policy Center and Brookings Institution, said allowing a temporary tax provision to expire is different from voting for a tax increase. ""In both cases, taxes would go up, but if the claim is that she VOTED for it, that seems not right to me,"" Gale wrote in an email. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said on Facebook the Hillary Clinton ""voted to raise taxes on workers earning as little as $41,500."" Clinton voted for a nonbinding Senate resolution in 2008 that envisioned a world where many of the Bush-era tax cuts would have been allowed to sunset, as intended, at the end of 2010. In that world, tax rates would have gone up for someone making about $41,500 a year. But Clinton also said that had she been elected president, she would not have supported such a change and promised not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $250,000 a year. Neither action ultimately mattered -- Clintonâs vote didnât carry the force of law and she lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. The Republican Party of Floridaâs statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",8/29/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/29/republican-party-florida/republican-party-florida-facebook-post-misses-mark/,1,,
"Says Ron Johnson ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas.""",Feingold: Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that help ship Wisconsin jobs overseas.,"In the race for the U.S. Senate, a new  TV ad  from challenger Russ Feingold claims that U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, the Republican incumbent, ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."" When it comes to attacks on Republican officeholders, this claim is not new. In 2014,  PolitiFact National wrote : ""Democrats and their advocates have washed, rinsed and are now repeating one of their favorite talking points from 2012: that â(Insert Republican Here) supports tax breaks for corporations that ship jobs overseas.â "" The piece called the description ""so simplistic as to be misleading,"" adding there is no specific tax break for sending jobs to other countries. OK, 2012 â¦ 2014 â¦ 2016 â¦ weâre sensing a trend here. Letâs take a look at how Feingoldâs claim fares on the Truth-O-Meter. Bring Jobs Home Act The Feingold campaign cited five votes by Johnson, two of which were on what was termed the  Bring Jobs Home Act , which would have given companies credit for bringing jobs to the United States and denied existing deductions associated with moving a business outside the country. Those two votes were specifically addressed in a  2014 factcheck involving a claim against U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky . The claim in the 2014 piece was that McConnell voted ""three times for corporate tax breaks that send Kentucky jobs overseas."" Feingoldâs campaign emphasized that the claim in their ad was that Johnson voted five times for tax breaks that  help  companies ship jobs overseas, not that corporate tax breaks by themselves are responsible for sending jobs outside the U.S. ""Like that PolitiFact notes, McConnell voted against denying deductions for costs associated with outsourcing,"" Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said in an email to PolitiFact. ""That helps a company attempting to ship its jobs elsewhere."" But the earlier item noted: ""The tax breaks that the law would have stopped are actually  standard business expense deductions . Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. But this isnât a special provision just for businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California."" Tax experts said there is very little money associated with these standard deductions and ""getting rid of deductions for business expenses associated with outsourcing would not be nearly enough to affect a companyâs decision to engage in foreign activity."" The legislation was proposed in  2012  and  2014  and Johnson voted ""no"" on procedural measures in each case, functionally voting to block the legislation from moving forward. The measures failed on procedural votes. The legislation itself was ""almost entirely symbolic,"" PolitiFact reported. Three votes on budget amendments Now letâs turn to the other three votes, taken in March 2015 and cited by the Feingold campaign, this time on amendments to  Congressâ concurrent budget resolution  for fiscal year 2016. Two were proposed by Democrats and a third was proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent who ran as a Democrat in the 2016 presidential race. The amendments were opposed by Republicans, with the two Independents voting with the Democrats. --  Amendment 817  statement of purpose: ""To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide tax benefits to patriot employers that invest in American jobs and provide fair pay and benefits to workers and to eliminate tax benefits for corporations that ship jobs overseas."" --  Amendment 523  statement of purpose: ""To prevent United States companies from getting tax benefits for moving jobs overseas, to end offshore tax loopholes including inversions, and to provide incentives for United States companies to relocate overseas jobs to the United States."" --  Amendment 323  statement of purpose: ""To create millions of middle class jobs by investing in our nation's infrastructure paid for by raising revenue through closing loopholes in the corporate and international tax system."" USA TODAY reported  that amendment 323 targets ""tax loopholes"" that ""let corporations and wealthy Americans shift jobs and profits overseas."" But experts we spoke with said these votes had no practical effect. Congressâ concurrent budget resolution  does not have the force of law  and it would not be the place to change the tax code, said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""To me those are just sort of messaging -- they were all very much of a partisan vote,"" Ellis said. He added: ""You can argue, well, he voted against whatever the message that the member, the Senator, was trying to get across, but I wouldn't necessarily say that was voting for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas because if he had voted for it, it wouldnât have had any effect and voting against it didnât have any effect."" In addition, he said, tax reform  would have to originate in the House , and it would be dealt with by the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means -- not on the floor of the Senate in a budget resolution. In an email, Johnsonâs campaign said the senatorâs position is that ""we should scrap the tax code, rather than favor any single deduction."" Our rating Feingoldâs campaign ad said Johnson ""voted five times for tax breaks that help companies ship Wisconsin jobs overseas."" By voting against the Bring Jobs Home Act, Feingold is correct that Johnson voted against denying deductions associated with moving a business out of the country. But, as the 2014 PolitiFact notes, the law was mostly symbolic and these arenât deductions specifically for moving jobs elsewhere, which is how the statement could easily be interpreted. The amendments to the budget resolution on which he voted had no practical effect, experts told us. We rate this claim False.",8/26/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/26/russ-feingold/feingold-johnson-voted-five-times-tax-breaks-help-/,1,,
"Says in Washington, D.C., Sen. Richard Burr ""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks.""",Attack ad hits Sen. Richard Burr on votes to cut taxes for millionaires.,"The first television ad from Senate hopeful Deborah Ross, a North Carolina Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a self-serving politician. It shows Ross talking on the phone with an actor playing Burr, lounging in a posh office. ""You took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut your own taxes and raise taxes on working folks,"" Ross tells the fictional Burr in the ad. A press release announcing the ad was even more direct: ""While Burrâs own wealth has tripled since he has been in the Senate, he has voted to raise taxes on the middle-class and working families while cutting them for millionaires like himself."" The adâs claim is a mouthful, but it makes some hefty allegations. We wondered if it was true that Burr became a millionaire in Washington then voted to cut taxes for millionaires like himself. And did he also vote to raise taxes on middle class and working families? Burrâs growing wealth The ad says Burr ""took millions from special interests, went (to D.C.) and cashed in."" Thatâs a bit misleading, since special interests canât give directly to politicians. Thatâs called bribery, and thereâs no evidence Burr has taken bribes. But his campaigns have received millions from special interests. When Burr first ran for Senate in 2004, he received the most PAC contributions of any Senate candidate, according to a News & Observer report. This year, not much has changed. Burrâs campaign is the No. 1 recipient of contributions from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Through June 30, 82 percent of the $8.7 million he has raised came from political action committees or large individual donors. By comparison, 74 percent of the $3.9 million Ross raised has come from PACs and large donors. Burrâs successful campaigning gives him a  congressional salary  of $174,000. That salary â plus investments in real estate and the stock market â helped Burr become a millionaire during his two decades in the House and Senate. He served in the House from 1995 to 2005, and in the Senate since 2005. In that time he has made about $3.6 million in pre-tax salary. We donât know exactly how much heâs worth because of the rules about what liabilities and assets members of Congress do and donât have to report. Roll Call, which compiles an annual ranking of members of Congress by minimum possible wealth, said Burr was worth  a minimum of $1.6 million  last year, ranked 44th in the Senate and 152nd overall. He was worth  about $500,000  in 2004, when he first ran for Senate, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Taxes on the wealthy Rossâ claim about Burrâs record on taxes is nearly identical to a claim made in a 2012 Wisconsin Senate race that PolitiFact rated  Half True . Four years have passed, though, and we were curious if there was any new information. Both that previous claim and Rossâ ad cited votes cast in 2011 and 2012 in support of Rep. Paul Ryanâs budget proposals. Neither budget passed. But Ross spokesman Austin Vevurka said the ad specifically talked about what Burr voted to do, not what he has done. And the ad is correct that Burr did vote to cut taxes on wealthy people like himself. Ryanâs plans both years wouldâve lowered the tax rates of all the highest income brackets, including Burrâs. Not counting his stocks, in 2012 Burr made $174,000 in Senate salary and owned real estate that brought in income somewhere between $115,002 and $1,050,000, according to his financial disclosure forms. His taxes wouldâve dropped substantially had the budget passed, as it wouldâve created just two income tax brackets: 10 and 25 percent. The income tax system, at that time and now, has six brackets and reaches nearly 40 percent at the top. Burrâs votes to help his fellow millionaires havenât all been unsuccessful. In 2012, he and other Senate Republicans blocked discussion on the so-called  Buffett Rule , which wouldâve raised taxes on wealthy investors. That wasnât a vote to cut taxes, but it was a vote to keep them at the same level. Taxes on the middle class The question of whether Burr voted to increase taxes on middle class or working people is trickier. Thatâs because Ryanâs budgets promised to cut income tax deductions and loopholes â butÂ did not provide many specifics about what would be cut and what would remain, leading to speculation. ""Depending on which think tank you ask about the Ryan Budget, you will get a different answer,"" said Burrâs communications director, Becca Watkins. ""This is because the Ryan budget suggested tax simplification, but it did not specify how taxes should exactly be changed."" Watkins  is right . However, Ryanâs budget was clear that it wouldâve kept the low tax rates on capital gains, dividends and other investment wealth. As a result, Peter Orszag, a banking executive and former budget wonk under both Bush and Obama,  wrote in 2012  that of what remained to be cut, ""most of the other big tax breaks â such as the mortgage interest deduction, state and local tax deductibility, and pension and health tax benefits â help the middle class."" That same year,  an analysis  found that households earning between $50,000 and $100,000 would see their taxes increase by $1,358 annually if Ryanâs budget passed, and upper middle class households making between $100,000 and $200,000 would see an increase of $2,681. However, like anything else analyzing the budget, that report had to rely on speculation. It also was commissioned by a Congressional committee led by Democrats. Ross did cite one piece of evidence the previous Half True claim did not â  a 2013 study  that found tax reforms that Burr voted for that year (which, yet again, failed) would have possibly raised taxes on middle class families. But again, its numbers were speculative and it was done by a liberal think tank. It also acknowledged there couldâve been ways to avoid increasing taxes on the middle class, such as increasing the deficit. Watkins said Burr didnât think Ryanâs budgets were ""perfect,"" but he feared budgets proposed by Democrats wouldâve led to even higher taxes. ""To suggest he supports increasing taxes on the middle class is baseless,"" she said. Our ruling Ross said Burr ""took millions from special interests, went there and cashed in, voted to cut (his) own taxes and raise taxes on working folks."" The part about special interest money needs clarification. The part about tax cuts for the wealthy is accurate, but the part about raising taxes on the middle class is purely speculative â it could be right or it could be wrong, and we simply canât know for sure. The adâs claims are partially accurate but need additional information, so we rate this claim Half True.",8/25/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/25/deborah-ross/attack-ad-hits-sen-richard-burr-votes-cut-taxes-mi/,1,,
"Says Marco Rubio ""voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act.""","Rubio voted against the Violence Against Women Act, Murphy says.","Democratic U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy is attacking Marco Rubio, his presumptive general election opponent in the race for Senate, for allegedly voting against domestic violence measures. Murphy lambasted Rubio for having a ""terrible record on womenâs health"" in an  Aug. 19 post on his website . Murphyâs post said Rubio opposed the right to choose an abortion, Obamacare and Planned Parenthood. ""He even voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act,"" Murphyâs campaign wrote. That sounded like a ready-made attack for election season, so we checked the voting record. Sure enough, Rubio voted against the legislation. But he had his reasons. Qualified support The original  1994 Violence Against Women Act  was championed by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. It provided grants to authorities on the state and local levels for domestic violence hotlines, police training, legal and housing assistance, and more. It has been credited for a  decrease in domestic violence and an upswing in reporting incidents to police . The act was reauthorized in 2005, then due to expire in 2011. That brings us to Rubioâs first term. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,  sponsored a Senate bill in 2011  to continue the provisions of the act. It didnât come to a vote until the following year. Rubio said he supported reauthorizing the law. But he voted against it. On April 26, 2012, Rubio and 30 other Republicans  voted against Leahyâs bill , which still passed with at least some support from both sides of the aisle. Rubio released a statement after the vote saying he was in favor of the act, but  opposed portions of the bill . Rubio pointed out he had  voted for a proposed amendment  he thought better addressed rape kit backlogs, sentencing guidelines and law enforcement databases. He added that he was against Leahyâs bill because it didnât deal with spending controls the way he liked and gave the Justice Department control over state programs. ""I support reauthorizing the current Violence Against Women Act as written and hope we can vote for it once it comes out of the House-Senate conference committee,"" Rubio said. Leahyâs bill passed the Senate, but  died in the House that year . The reauthorization  came back in 2013 , with Rubio  again voting against it  in the Senate, where it  passed Feb. 13 with bipartisan support, 78-22 . All 22 nays were Republicans. Rubio  released another statement saying he liked provisions of the bill  and was proud it included human trafficking protections, but he again said he wished the original law had been reauthorized. ""Unfortunately, I could not support the final, entire legislation that contains new provisions that could have potentially adverse consequences,"" he said. He echoed some concerns from the year prior, saying he disagreed with how the bill shifted funding from domestic violence programs to sexual assault programs and took power out of state hands. He also opposed a provision allowing Native American tribal governments greater jurisdiction in abuse cases, giving tribal courts the power to prosecute non-Native American men. On Feb. 28, 2013, the House reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act with a  bipartisan vote of 286-138 , with 87 Republicans voting for it. Our ruling Murphy said Rubio ""voted against the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act."" Rubio voiced support for the original law, but he and some Republicans in both the Senate and House opposed certain provisions added to the bill pertaining to spending and federal oversight. Rubio voted against the bill in 2012 and 2013, but it passed with bipartisan support the second time. Even though he had clearly stated his reasons why, Rubio still voted nay.

"""...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted âyesâ (on the Iran nuclear deal).""",Anti-Duckworth Super Pac ad goes nuclear on Iran deal.,"In a new television ad supporting U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC went after his opponent, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Hoffman Estates. In the 30-second spot, a female narrator attacks Duckworthâs national security track record, slamming her for supporting the Iran nuclear deal. The ad portrays the Iran nuclear deal as a bad one and says recently unearthed information makes the deal even worse. The narrator says, ""...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted âyesâ (on the Iran nuclear deal)."" The  Politico Illinois Playbook  said the spot is runningÂ in ""Rockford and number of downstate markets, namely Peoria, Champaign and Springfield."" Tammy Duckworth did vote yes for the  Iran nuclear deal , officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Thatâs an established fact. But did secret documents reveal Iranians could have access to nuclear weapons earlier than the 15-year window outlined in the JCPOA? We took a look into the PACâs claim to find out. Independent Voice for Illinois PAC First off, what is the Independent Voice for Illinois (IVFI) PAC? Itâs whatâs known as an independent expenditure PAC or a Super PAC. Independent expenditure PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in support of or in opposition to political candidates, but are prohibited from coordinating their activities with or donating directly to candidate campaigns. This means that Kirk would not have known about the IVFI ad before it appeared. Thereâs not much information out there on the group. But we did find the PACâs treasurer Jo Merlau submitted its statement of organization in February 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission. The political research website  Open Secrets  shows IVFI has raised more than $1.6 million in 2016 with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations coming from people like Chicago businessman Ken Griffin and New York hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Open Secrets also showed IVFI spent money on vendors supporting failed Republican presidential candidates  John Kasich ,  Marco Rubio  and  Bobby Jindal . Notably, IVFI filed three independent expenditures in late July and early August with the FEC for media production. The payments went to the Washington, D.C., media firm Strategic Media Services, Inc., and the documents showed a media placement/media production order opposing Duckworth. Strategic Media Services did not return calls to confirm whether they were responsible for the ad. The Iran deal, the IVFI advertisement and the Associated Press Next, letâs look at the Iran nuclear deal. In the original document outlining the deal, the JCPOA never says it would allow Iran to build or obtain a nuclear weapon before the 15-year deal expires. In fact, the JCPOA says, ""Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons,"" and reiterates that point throughout the deal. The IVFI PAC video ad says secret documents that were leaked contain information about the Iran deal. An illustration in the video indicates they are referencing information reported in a July 18 article by the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported an unnamed source leaked unpublished information about an add-on agreement to the JCPOA. The source told the Associated Press members of Congress knew about the add-on agreement, but its contents never were made public. However, the Associated Press only references one confidential document in its story. The Associated Press, in fact, says this ""confidential document is the only text linked to last yearâs deal between Iran and six foreign powers that hasnât been made public."" IVFIâs ad incorrectly says there are multiple secret documents. That implied the federal government was hiding more information than was actually reported in the Associated Press story. Investigating the specific language of the IVFI ad reveals another discrepancy with the Associated Press story. The IVFI ad says ""Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told,"" according to ""secret documents."" However, the Associated Press story never says that. The story says the leaked document revealed that Iranâs nuclear limitations will ease up earlier than what is outlined in the 15-year deal approved in January. It also says the internally negotiated deal would advance ""Tehran's ability to build a bomb even before the end of the pact."" Even though Iran will have the ability, it would not be allowed to create a fully completed weapon until the deal ends. The Associated Press goes further, saying the contents of the secret document give Iran fewer limits on installing more advanced centrifuges to churn uranium for the core of a nuclear weapon. However, the Associated Press explicitly says Iranâs ability to install these newer centrifuges doesnât mean it would be allowed to build bombs before the 15-year pact ends. From the Associated Press story: (The centrifuge machines) will give Iran a huge potential boost in enrichment capacity, including  bomb making  should it choose to do so. But it can be put to use only after the deal expires. The story never reports Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than outlined in the JCPOA, as claimed in the IVFI advertisement. Â  The secret document and the JCPOA The Associated Press story reveals the contents of a secret document showing an add-on agreement imposing fewer restrictions to the JCPOA. But Daniel Joyner, the director of international programs at the University of Alabama School of Law, says not so fast. ""The (Associated Press) story isnât wrong. Itâs just a little misleading,"" he said. Joyner points out the contents of the leaked secret document arenât much different from pages 6 and 7 of the JCPOA, which deals with centrifuge and uranium enrichment regulation. ""Youâll see there that the commitments with regard to centrifuges last for 10 years, not for 15. So the confidential document, which discusses years 11-13, does not contradict the terms of the JCPOA. So why would anyone interpret this new information as something that conflicts with the JCPOA? ""There are people out there who are out to kill (the JCPOA),"" Joyner said. ""The fact that it was from a confidential source throws up some red flags. Thereâs nothing contradictory in the leaked documents."" Our ruling In their anti-Duckworth campaign ad, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC says ""...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told.

"""U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!""",Libertarian Buckley on target about GOP's Isakson and federal debt.,"Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley knows he faces an uphill battle in his campaign to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson. Libertarians usually pull only low single-digits of the overall Georgia voter turnout. And Isakson is a veteran lawmaker and a founding member of the state Republican establishment, which today holds sway over all statewide offices. Buckley ran unsuccessful campaigns for U.S. Senate in 2004 and 2008. But in 2008, he won Â enough votes in the general election to force a runoff between Republican Saxby Chambliss and Democrat Jim Martin. An Â Atlanta tax attorney, Buckley thinks he has an issue that will resonate with voters if he can only get them to Â pay attention and understand the gravitas of the soaring federal debt. ""U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"" Buckley states on his website as part of a graphic about Isakson votes to raise the federal debt limit. Is that possible? Has Isakson, who has pushed for a balanced budget amendment and who also blasts the federal debt on his campaign website, Â actually assisted the spending spree? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a look. Buckley and Democrat Jim Barksdale will face Isakson in the November election. We first contacted Buckley, who said the graphic refers to Isaksonâs repeated votes to raise the federal debt limit, which essentially means raising the cap on what the government is permitted to spend to pay the bills. ""I believe Mr. Isakson has, irresponsibly and immorally, voted to grow the federal government through debt spending to the detriment of young people and our country."" Buckley said in an email. He later added: ""He largely created the mess and then voted to fund what he created."" Buckley said Isakson voted for debt-bloating items like the war in Iraq and the Medicare prescription drug benefit and subsequently voted for debt-ceiling increases to cover the cost of the increased spending. Isaksonâs campaign manager, Trey Kilpatrick, dismissed Buckley assertions, but did not dispute Isaksonâs vote to raise the debt limit. ""Mr. Buckley is trying to mislead voters by citing debt ceiling votes (required for solvency) without citing Johnny's votes against trillions of dollars in unnecessary spending, including voting against a minimum of $5 trillion in debt ceiling votes alone, or his vote for the Budget Control Act, which cut spending by over $2 trillion and, according to the Heritage Foundation, 'has shrunk the size of government more effectively than any budget tool in a generation,"" Kilpatrick wrote in an email. The debate over the federal debt comes at an interesting time. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office earlier this month Â released a report that warned of vastly increased federal debt when compared to the Gross Domestic Product over the next three decades. Â Federal debt held by the public was 39 percent of GDP in 2008, but is now about 75 percent, the budget office said. That could rise to 86 percent by 2026 and a whopping 141 percent by 2046. ""The prospect of such large debt poses substantial risks for the nation and presents policymakers with significant challenges,"" the budget office warned. The CBO said the governmentâs spending growth is outpacing revenues as spending soars for popular programs like Social Security and Â Medicare and interest on the governmentâs existing debt. The most popular programs cost a lot to maintain, Â and neither Democrats nor Republicans want to be blamed for cuts, experts told PolitiFact. PolitiFact consulted political and budget experts across the county. Their verdict: Buckley has a point about Isaksonâs spending votes, but there is a lot of context missing. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said many of the most popular federal programs are also the most expensive. That puts politicians of all stripes in a difficult spot. ""Some, like Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid, Defense spending, interest on the debt etc. are bigger than others,"" Sabato said. Â ""Given that many of these categories are mandatory, itâs hard to imagine that any member of Congress hasnât cast votes that effectively increase the amount of debt the country incurs."" Chris Edwards, an economist with the Cato Institute, said that by voting for debt-limit increases members of Congress have ""kicked the can down the road"" on the governmentâs debt problem. ""Voting for annual deficit-financed budgets causes the accumulated debt to rise, but voting to increase the legal debt limitâas Isakson and others do regularlyâratifies the unsound practice of endlessly spending more than is taken in,"" Edwards wrote in an email. Kennesaw State University political scientist Kerwin Swint said voting Â to raise the debt ceiling is not quite the same thing as voting to create new programs or authorize new spending items ""The alternative to not raising the debt ceiling is shutting down the government,"" Swint said. Buckleyâs claim is ""technically accurate of course but totally misleading,"" saidAlan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Abramowitz said the U.S. should Â take advantage of extremely low interest rates to borrow more money to invest in much needed infrastructure improvements and other projects. ""It cannot be emphasized enough that the debt obsession of some conservative politicians and pundits is totally misplaced at a time when the investing community is practically begging to purchase U.S. treasury notes at extremely low interest rates,"" Abramowitz said. Â  Our ruling: Â  Â  Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Allen Buckley proclaimed on his campaign website: ""U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!"" Isakson did indeed vote to raise the debt ceiling, so Buckley has a valid point. But the alternative would be risking a government shutdown. That said, Buckley also pointed at that Isakson voted for some of the very programs that bloated the debt in the first place. We rate his claim Mostly True.

"""Mike Pence voted against expanding the Childrenâs Health Insurance program, which Hillary helped to start.""",Howard Dean largely right on Mike Pence's health policy record.,"Speakers at the Democratic National Convention made clear their disdain for GOP presidential nomineeÂ Donald Trump. Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean did just that but also managed to attack Trump's running mate, Mike Pence, on his health policy record. In the  speech , Dean said that Trump would ""rip up Obamacare."" He continued by saying, ""His vice presidential pick is no better. Mike Pence voted against expanding the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, which Hillary helped to start,"" among other claims about Pence's health care policy positions.Â  We decided to look into Dean's statement about Pence and the Children's Health Insurance Program, called CHIP. Is Dean's statement accurate?Â  Pence on the Childrenâs Health Insurance Program The Childrenâs Health Insurance Program, orÂ CHIP,Â was first created by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 under Bill Clintonâs administration.  According to Medicaid , it has insured over 8 million low-income children who could not afford private coverage. The Hillary Clinton campaign has touted her role in passing the legislation. While  she did play a significant part from the White House , others were pivotal in moving it through the Republican-controlled Congress, notably the late Sen.Â Ted Kennedy. We've rated the statement that she helped get the program ""done"" as  Mostly True .Â  So, did Pence vote against the legislation? Pence served in Congress from 2001 to 2012. During that time, there were four major roll call votes directly affecting CHIP. Although Pence did not vote in favor of the reauthorization proposals in 2007 or 2009, he did offer statements on the legislation. In an editorial for the  Star Press  in Indiana, Pence wrote that while he supports expanding health insurance for poor children, the Democratic legislation ""represented a massive expansion of this anti-poverty program into the middle class."" Instead of the CHIP reauthorizations, Pence had supported other bills like the  More Children, More Choices Act of 2007 , which expand coverage but use tax credits. Deanâs assertion that Pence voted against CHIP is accurate, though Pence did support Republican legislation to get health care to low-income children. Pence in Indiana We should note that Pence's health care record isn't entirely against the Democratic policy agenda.Â While Dean attacked Penceâs congressional record, Penceâs most notable healthcare-related policies have come during his time as governor of Indiana. The state is known for the  Healthy Indiana Plan (HIP) , which many have called a compromise between Obamacare and conservative health policy ideas. HIP expanded the stateâs Medicaid coverage by using federal dollars, which is now optional for states since a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. While adopting provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Indiana expanded Medicaid through a waiver plan, allowing the state to add additional stipulations and restrictions. Particularly contentious is HIPâs premium contribution requirement, which forces Medicaid recipients to pay a small premium each month. If people fail to pay, they are locked out of benefits for six months. Sherry Glied, professor of public service at New York University with an extensive background in health policy, notes that the benefits of Indianaâs Medicaid expansion ""include the same essential benefits required under Obamacare for all individual market and Medicaid plans, among them mental health and substance use benefits."" So, although Dean is largely correct about Penceâs voting record on CHIP in Congress, Penceâs policies as governor have added other benefits at the state level. Our ruling Dean criticized Penceâs health policy record, saying, ""Mike Pence voted against expanding the Childrenâs Health Insurance program,which Hillary helped to start."" That claim is largely accurate. Pence voted against CHIP when he was in Congress, and Clinton did have a role in starting the program when she was First Lady. But it is important to note that Pence has supported health policy as governor ofÂ Indiana that was in line with health policies that Dean and other Democrats support.Â We rate the statement Mostly True.",8/8/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/aug/08/howard-dean/howard-dean-largely-right-mike-pences-health-polic/,1,,
"Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups.""",Tim Canova attacks Debbie Wasserman Schultz's record on Big Sugar.,"A nasty-looking toxic algae bloom on Floridaâs coasts has oozed into political races, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultzâs Democratic primary. Her opponent, Tim Canova,  toured the mucky scene  in Stuart wearing a surgical mask. He says that Wasserman Schultz shares in the blame for the algae that extends from Lake Okeechobee to Florida coastlines on the Treasure Coast and west coast. Canova said Wasserman Schultz, who represents South Florida, has sided with the main polluters of the water that flows into the Everglades: the sugar industry. Wasserman Schultz doesnât ""want us to know that she has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry and other agribusinesses, as well as for delays in cleanups, while failing to deliver federal funds for any real solution,"" he said on  Medium  July 9. Wasserman Schultz defended her environmental record to the  Sun Sentinel , concluding, ""I will continue to walk the walk on fighting to restore our precious River of Grass while my opponent just continues to talk."" Time for PolitiFact Florida to weigh in. Algae and Big Sugar Everybody agrees that the algae is bad for the environment and business. But they disagree on who is to blame. Pollution from fertilizer, manure and septic waste from suburbs and farms poured into Lake Okeechobee. That pollution stimulated the growth of algae, so when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released water from the lake to avoid a breach of the surrounding dike, the algae-ridden water traveled to other waters in Florida. Some politicians blame the federal government for the water release as well as its failure to raise the dike. Others blame the state of Florida for siding with the sugar industry and resisting calls to redirect water through sugar land. In Florida, Big Sugar has given generously to  state and local politicians  and to federal candidates, including  Wasserman Schultz . ""The sugar industry is completely ambidextrous as far as its ability to penetrate the Republican and Democratic camps,"" said Charles Lee, director of advocacy for Audubon Florida. Everglades delay vote Canovaâs campaign points to Wasserman Schultzâs vote in the state Senate to delay Everglades cleanup and to votes on two farm bills while in Congress. In 2003, then state Sen. Wasserman Schultz  voted  to  delay for seven years  the requirement for sugar companies to clean up polluted discharges that had hurt the Everglades. It passed the state Senate 38-0 and the House 96-18, and Gov. Jeb Bush signed it into law. The well-financed sugar industry fought for the delay, while environmental groups opposed it. Two days later, Wasserman Schultz changed her vote to ""no"" because she  said  she was ""betrayed and misled"" about the facts. The Senate passed amendments that they believed were offered by the U.S. Justice Department but had actually been written by state environmental officials. Changing a vote is ceremonial only and carries zero practical effect -- except public relations. Ryan Banfill, Wasserman Schultzâs spokesman, said that she initially supported the bill because it included a provision to buy sugar lands for filtration and was better than a 20-year-delay alternative. Sugar votes in Congress Canovaâs campaign also says Wasserman Schultz supported the sugar industry because of her votes to renew the 1981 Farm Bill in  2008  and  2014 . The legislation is a sweeping bill that funds an array of nutrition and agriculture programs for multiple years. So if Wasserman Schultz voted against the farm bill, she would have also voted against food stamps, assistance to food banks and economic development programs in rural areas such as  providing broadband internet service . But if Wasserman Schultz had opposed the sugar portion of the bills she could have said so and she didnât, Canovaâs campaign said. The  farm bill  gives lucrative benefits to the sugar industry. Specifically, it gives loans to processors and limits sugar imports to the United States. The government can also buy the surplus sugar and sell it for ethanol production. These benefits amount to market controls that reduce the supply of sugar, thus making it more expensive, said Josh Sewell, a policy analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that is critical of the sugar policy. The industry disagrees with the term ""subsidy."" ""A direct subsidy -- a check -- we do not get that,"" said Ryan Weston, executive vice president of the Florida Sugarcane League. But Sewell said the price controls, marketing allotments and limits on imports are all government manipulations designed to provide an economic benefit to a set group and function as subsidies. ""Any governmental action that reduces the cost of doing business or increases prices beyond the normal functioning of a free market is a subsidy,"" he said. ""In this case consumers, food manufacturers, and sugar producers outside of the United States are on the losing end."" The industry argues it needs the aid to compete globally with other countries that subsidize sugar and that the aid helps save jobs. Critics, including candy companies and consumer watchdogs, argue that it drives up prices for consumers and amounts to corporate welfare. In recent years, there have been  several national proposals  by Democrats and Republicans to change the sugar program, but votes are rare. In June 2013, however, the House and Senate voted on sugar amendments that would have scaled back the industryâs benefits. The amendments failed in both chambers with  Wasserman Schultz voting ""no."" Most of the Florida delegation voted against the amendment, including both of Floridaâs senators  Marco Rubio, a Republican, and Bill Nelson, a Democrat . Banfill said Wasserman Schultz voted against the amendment because she said it would keep the market stable, protect American jobs and maintain the program allowing the government to buy and then sell surplus sugar to ethanol producers. Lee, of Audubon Florida, says Wasserman Schultz isnât alone in her support of the federal governmentâs sugar policy: ""The same attack could be applied to virtually every member of Congress from Florida and it could be applied to virtually every member of the Legislature."" Banfill pointed to other efforts by Wasserman Schultz to clean up the Everglades and her 92 percent lifetime rating from the League of Conservation Voters. She has supported a  clean water rule  proposed by the EPA and helped get the authorization included in the budget for multiple segments of the  Tamiami Trail  to restore natural water flow to part of the Everglades. She is one of many cosponsors of the  Central Everglades Planning Project  that includes restoration projects but hasnât received a vote yet. Those are all steps that could help the Everglades and the environment, but the sugar industryâs benefits from the government remain in place. ""Yes, these positions were important and significant,"" Lee said. ""However, these positions did not really challenge the sugar industry. On core issues for âbig sugarâ they have her support."" This is no different from every other major political leader in Florida, he added. Our ruling Canova said Wasserman Schultz ""has voted for huge subsidies for the sugar industry ... as well as for delays in cleanups."" In 2003, while in the state Senate, Wasserman Schultz was part of a unanimous vote for a seven-year delay to clean up the Everglades. Canova omits that two days later she changed her vote, but the vote had no practical effect and the measure passed anyway. Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didnât contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry. The farm bill is a sweeping bill that benefits a long list of programs -- not just sugar. Wasserman Schultz has taken other steps to support Everglades cleanup. But Canovaâs point about her specific actions is largely accurate.

"Says that as a U.S. senator, Russ Feingold ""voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times.""","At GOP national convention, Ron Johnson attacks challenger Russ Feingold's support for the military.","U.S. Sen.  Ron Johnson  used part of his  July 19, 2016, speech  at the Republican National Convention to boost his re-election campaign, attacking challenger and ex-senator  Russ Feingold  for voting ""against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" Itâs a claim we want to check, given that Johnson made it in the context of arguing that electing Feingold would made America less safe. But first a little on how the Wisconsin Republican got there. The attack Johnson opened his  speech in Cleveland  with this greeting: ""Ladies and gentleman, what difference, at this point, does it make?"" It was a shot at  Hillary Clinton . While secretary of state, Clinton uttered that phrase to him during a Senate hearing on the bombing of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans died in the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. (Our  In Context on Clintonâs remarks  is one of our most-clicked items. And PolitiFact National rated as  Mostly True  another claim from the speech in which Johnson took credit for inducing Clintonâs comments.) After criticizing the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Johnson continued his speech by warning of dangers posed by terrorism if Democrats win in the November 2016 elections. Then he pivoted to attacking Feingold, a Democrat who served three terms in the Senate before Johnson defeated him in 2010. ""So, the question is, when will America actually confront this terrible reality. We certainly wonât, if Democrats win in November,"" Johnson said. ""In Wisconsin, Iâm running against Russ Feingold, a man who even after 9/11, was the only senator to vote against giving law enforcement the tools they need to help stop international terror. During his 18-year Senate career, he also voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" During his current campaign, Feingold has defended,  and raised money on , casting the only vote against the Patriot Act in 2001. He said the law ""gave the federal government way too much power to spy on people without adequate oversight."" But in the context of Johnsonâs remarks about terrorism and being tough on defense, what does it mean that Feingold ""voted against authorizing our military""? In short, Johnson is making an attack that is broader than a claim about 11 votes. Understanding the NDAA To back Johnsonâs statement, which is also made in a  Johnson TV ad , his campaign staff cited 11 instances in which Feingold voted against the National Defense Authorization Act. But here are two key points  made by   three   experts  on defense budgets about NDAA votes: 1.  The annual NDAA contains thousands of pages and hundreds of provisions, which means a lawmaker might vote against it for any number of reasons. Some lawmakers think it doesnât authorize enough funds, others might think it authorizes too much; or a no vote could come from opposition to a policy in the bill, such as gays in the military or moving detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. ""Even if youâre the biggest proponent of a strong defense, you could find something to object to in the NDAA almost every year,"" said  Todd Harrison , director of defense budget analysis for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a centrist think tank. 2.  The NDAA authorizes funds, but it doesnât provide any. Money is actually allocated through a separate appropriations process. So, voting no on an NDAA would not result in any shutdown, like voting no on appropriations could. Indeed, some federal agencies operate for years without an authorization bill. ""An authorization is just a license to hunt, it doesnât actually bag you a deer,"" said Â  Steve Ellis , vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a public spending watchdog group. We also found that although Feingold sometimes was among only a small number of Democrats voting against an NDAA, often he was joined by conservative Republicans: 1993:  22 senators  voted no, including Republican stalwarts Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Vietnam war veteran John McCain of Arizona, the GOPâs 2008 presidential nominee. 1994 : Feingold was joined by McCain and another war veteran, Bob Dole of Kansas, the GOPâs 1996 president nominee, voting no. 2009 : Feingold was the only Senate Democrat to vote against the NDAA. But  28 Republicans , including conservative stalwarts such as Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the current Senate majority leader, and Jeff Sessions of Arizona, also voted no. Feingold has given different reasons for his no votes. In 2008, for example,  he said  he supported a number of provisions in the NDAA, including a pay raise for troops and limiting the outsourcing of private security functions in war zones, but voted no because it contained ""$70 billion to continue the war in Iraq but no language mandating that we safely redeploy our troops."" It's also worth noting thatÂ Feingold did vote yes on a number of NDAAs, including in  November 2005 ,  June 2006  and  December 2010 , just before he left office. Our rating Johnson argued that Feingold would be weak on defense, and claimed that as a senator, Feingold ""voted against authorizing our military 11 separate times."" During his 18 years in the Senate, Feingold did vote 11 times against the National Defense Authorization Act, an annual bill that authorizes defense spending levels and covers policy issues such as gays in the military. The 11 votes indicate a pretty clear pattern. But those were not votes to defund the military, given that appropriations bills provide funding. And experts told us conclusions canât be drawn about why a lawmaker votes no on the NDAA, given that sometimes lawmakers oppose it because of certain policy provisions. Moreover, lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum, including ex-military conservative Republicans, have voted against it over the years. For a statement that is partially accurate, we rate Johnsonâs statement Half True.",7/22/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/22/ron-johnson/gop-national-convention-ron-johnson-attacks-challe/,1,,
"Says he ""voted to remove Common Core from our schools.""","Ritch Workman says he voted to remove Common Core, but it's more complicated than that.","State Rep. Ritch Workman is looking to win a Florida Senate seat this fall, so heâs hoping to educate voters on his record of opposing Common Core. In an online campaign ad posted June 20, 2016, Workman said that eight years ago he ""promised to go to Tallahassee and cut taxes and shrink the size and scope of government."" He said he followed through, passing tax cuts, changes to government pensions and ethics reform. ""I also voted to remove Common Core from our schools,"" he said in the video. That statement riled up groups like Florida Parents Against Common Core, which accused Workman of ""misrepresenting the facts."" The group supports Workmanâs opponent, Rep. Debbie Mayfield, who in 2013  sponsored a bill to repeal the standards . That bill never got out of committee. But Workman told us he is telling the truth. We wanted to find out whether Workman voted to get rid of Common Core standards in Florida. A common history lesson Common Core is a set of voluntary, state-based standards developed by the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association. Created with input from teachers, parents and education experts, Common Coreâs goal was to make an education in one state comparable with the education in another. The final guidelines for math and English came out in 2010, and states could then decide whether to use them. Forty-five states, including Florida, voluntarily decided to accept the standards. Like most states, Florida was good with the plan at first, and the state Board of Education adopted Common Core in 2010. But critics of Common Core attacked it as a federal takeover of education, and  support for the guidelines waned . Workman describes it on his  Senate campaign website  as ""the federal governmentâs effort to nationalize our public schools."" But this fairly common misperception isnât accurate. Washington is not in charge of creating or implementing the benchmarks, the states are â and they are free to change or abandon the standards as they see fit. What the federal government  has  done is encourage state standards and offer some grant money to aid the process. Florida, for example, won a  $700 million federal grant  for that purpose. That support has aroused suspicion among detractors. Floridaâs method of dealing with the backlash, meanwhile, has been complex. Gov. Rick Scott  initially supported Common Core , but in 2013 he  ordered Florida to pull out of a consortium  of states that were working together to create a new test they all would share to track progress. Eventually, the state chose to develop its own replacement to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT. Scott also called for public hearings that led state education officials in 2014 to  recommend 98 changes to the benchmarks . Those proposed changes included things like 52 new calculus goals, guidelines for subjects beyond math and English, and a cursive writing requirement. The revisions were enough for the Florida Department of Education to consider the new guidelines separate from Common Core. Policy experts we talked to said they were more like extensions of the original standards. ""The resulting standards as we see them are closely aligned to the Common Core and high-quality (College and Career Readiness) standards in general,"" said Alyssa Schwenk, a spokeswoman at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. The state Board of Education  approved the revisions unanimously  in February 2014 and renamed them the  Florida Standards . So what, if anything, did Workman have to do with kicking Common Core out of class? A different standard Workman told us the votes he mentioned came during the legislative session after Scottâs intervention and the education departmentâs changes, which Workman said he supported. In April 2014, lawmakers passed  HB 7031 , a broad education bill that removed more than 30 mentions of the term ""Common Core"" from the books as the Department of Education adopted the Florida Standards. That bill passed the House and Senate unanimously. Workman also voted for  SB 1642 , which froze sanctions based on school grading for a year, while the FCAT replacement (eventually known as the Florida Standards Assessment) was created. ""Those two bills repealed Common Core from the DOE's education policy,"" Workman told us in an email. Keep in mind, the Florida Standards had already been adopted at this point. The Legislature didnât decide to revise the guidelines, the Board of Education did. While Workman may have opposed Common Core, the provisions heâs touting as his votes to remove the benchmarks were largely procedural after the change had already been made. So does that mean Common Core is out of Florida schools entirely? The name is certainly gone â ""Common Core is out,""  Scott said in a 2014 interview  â and the state says as much. ""My understanding is that Florida is no longer a participating state,"" Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters told PolitiFact Florida. But the Common Core State Standards Initiative still  lists Florida as a Common Core state . Olympia Meola, a spokeswoman for the Council of Chief State School Officers, told us the map showing those states on the initiativeâs website lists both ""states that have adopted the standards without any changes and those that have built upon and updated the Common Core State Standards to further fit their stateâs unique context and priorities."" ""It is common practice for states to revise their academic standards periodically, and, in doing so, to build upon previously adopted standards,"" Meola said. Thatâs what Florida did by adopting the Florida Standards. Blair Mann, spokeswoman for the pro-Common Core nonprofit Collaborative for Student Success, noted ""the standards are still remarkably similar, and considered comparable to, the Common Core State Standards that other states are implementing."" So while the term ""Common Core"" is gone, the bones of the standards remain. That means itâs not quite accurate to say Common Core is gone. A better term may be to say it has evolved. Many critics of the Florida Standards agree, saying  the new standards didnât go far enough , and were essentially based on Common Core guidelines with "" cosmetic changes ."" Â  That makes it difficult for Workman to make the claim he did, according to Abigail Swisher, an analyst at the New America Foundationâs Education Policy Program. ""Given that Florida is still designated a Common Core State, it would appear contradictory for any one person to claim that they have âremovedâ the Common Core in that state,"" she said. Our ruling Workman said he ""voted to remove Common Core from our schools."" Workman did vote to literally remove the term ""Common Core"" from state records as Florida switched over to the revised Florida Standards. Indeed, the broad education bill that made it law was voted for unanimously. But that was only  after  the Board of Education, and not the Legislature, agreed to revise the Common Core standards. Workmanâs vote did not affect the decision to make that change. Furthermore, the new benchmarks were largely additions to the original standards, so itâs difficult to definitively say Common Core is out of schools. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",7/11/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/11/ritch-workman/workman-voted-remove-common-core/,1,,
"Says Ron Johnson justifies his support of trade agreements by saying the U.S. has the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for displaced workers, but then he ""voted to eliminate it.""","Testing Russ Feingold claim about opponent Ron Johnson's views on trade, help for workers.","Republican U.S. Sen.

Feingold said: ""Let's be very clear. Senator Johnson says â to excuse his position on trade agreements â he says, well, we have the TAA. Guess who voted to eliminate it."" When Feingold was asked by reporters to elaborate, he said Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers who were eligible for the program. Is Feingold right? How the program works The Trade Adjustment Assistance program dates to the 1970s and was created to help workers who lost their jobs -- or whose wages or hours have been cut -- because of foreign competition. The program, in part, offers displaced workers temporary benefits and pays to train them with new skills so they can find a new job. In Wisconsin, the federal government has spent nearly $220 million in the last six years for worker benefits and training, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That includes money for enhanced  vocational training through the stateâs technical colleges  in programs such as information technology, healthcare and manufacturing. Proponents of the TAA program say it can lessen the blow of job losses that occur when companies move operations overseas to reduce labor costs â a practice that critics contend is facilitated by free trade agreements the United States has struck with other countries. Johnson has voiced general support for free trade , while Feingold voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement when he was a U.S. senator and  has opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership . Feingoldâs claim has two parts: Did Johnson specifically cite the Trade Adjustment Assistance program as a defense of trade agreements? When we asked Feingoldâs campaign for backup, officials pointed to a statement Johnson made in a  May 2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article : ""Free trade does help all economies. And there are dislocations. There are protections against those dislocations. We all support being able to help workers that have been displaced."" Despite what Feingold said, Johnson did not explicitly refer to the TAA in that statement. Rather he voiced general support for helping displaced workers. Indeed, Johnson campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger told us the TAA is ""ineffective and duplicative"" and in need of ""major reforms."" Johnsonâs campaign also pointed to a  House Budget Committee report  that said the federal government has other forms of aid, including at least 35 job training programs among eight departments and agencies. There are ""dozens of programs to help people who need assistance,"" Reisinger said. Did Johnson vote to eliminate the Trade Adjustment Assistance program? Johnson voted in September 2011  against a bill to reauthorize the program,  although the measure passed despite his opposition . Feingold also noted that Johnson voted at least once against providing three-year grants to technical colleges to train displaced workers eligible for TAA help. Those  grants  were  part of the 2009 economic stimulus package , which was approved before Johnson was in office. But  Johnson voted for legislation in 2011  that would have reduced TAA spending to pre-2009 levels; that proposal also failed. At the time, U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona,  said he offered the measure  because of concerns with TAAâs effectiveness and  because stimulus spending was supposed to be temporary . Our rating Feingold said Johnson had referred to the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to defend his position on trade agreements â but had voted against the TAA. However, Johnson referred only generally to worker ""protections,"" not to the TAA specifically. He did vote against reauthorizing the program in 2011 and also voted around the same time to pare down funding, which would have had the effect of cutting a career training program. Our definition for Mostly False is ""The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",7/6/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jul/06/russ-feingold/testing-russ-feingold-claim-about-opponent-ron-joh/,1,,
"Says Kelly Ayotte ""voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks.""","Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte voted against expanding gun background checks, twice.","In the wake of a mass shooting in Orlando, lawmakers in Washington have refocused their efforts on federal gun laws. But on Monday the U.S. Senate  shot down  a number of firearm bills, designed to expand or strengthen background checks and prevent sales to people on terror watchlists. And now the issue is becoming a central line of attack against Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who is seeking re-election in one of the most competitive races this year. The New Hampshire Democratic Party took the first swing, followed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, who is running for Ayotteâs senate seat. ""Ayotte voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- meaning dangerous individuals, including suspected terrorists, can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks,"" Hassanâs campaign said in an email on Tuesday, June 21, 2016. Â  We decided to take a look at Ayotteâs votes and see if she voted against expanded background checks, as Hassan said. The U.S. Senate took four votes June 20 on a variety of firearm proposals, all of which failed to earn the necessary 60 votes to progress. Hassanâs campaign pointed us to an amendment sponsored by U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat. Current law requires background checks only for purchases from federally licensed gun dealers. Murphyâs proposal would have expanded the checks to include sales at gun shows, over the internet and those between friends and family members. Ayotte joined Republican colleagues on a mostly partisan vote to defeat the measure 44-56, well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. ""The Murphy legislation is very broad ... and I think that there are concerns about it,"" Ayotte said Monday,  according to The Hill.  ""Iâve previously said that I think itâs important to fix the current system."" Ayotte voted against a similar background check amendment in 2013, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, which would have expanded background checks to cover gun shows and internet sales. Â  Back then, Ayotte instead supported an amendment by Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, which would have increased the mental health records given to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and provided money for prosecuting background check violations. But it did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet. It failed 52-48. On Monday, Grassley introduced a similar amendment, and Ayotte supported it, again. Like the amendment from three years earlier, it would have increased money for the background check system and further defined what it means to be ""mentally competent"" to buy a firearm, but did not expand background checks to cover any new firearms sales, including gun shows and internet sales. It resulted in a familiar outcome as three years ago: It failed 53-47. For the most part, Democrats favored the Murphy amendment, while Republicans supported Grassley. Â  Ayotte backed the Grassley amendment because she said it improves on the current system. Ayotteâs campaign spokeswoman said Hassanâs claim is misleading. ""The Murphy amendment, which was opposed by one of the Senateâs top Democrats, is a broad expansion of a flawed system, and does not require law enforcement notification when an individual who was on the terrorist watchlist in the past five years attempts to buy a firearm,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said in a statement. Ayotte did vote for two competing proposals Monday that sought to block the sale of firearms to suspected terrorists. One, proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, would let the attorney general stop anyone on the federal terrorist watch lists from buying a gun, according to the  Washington Post . Another, put forward by Republican Sen. John Cornyn, would let the government delay a sale to known or suspected terrorists for 72 hours while it investigated. Neither proposal passed, failing to win the needed 60 votes. Ayotte had previously voted against the Feinstein amendment, but voted Monday in support. Our ruling Maggie Hassan said Kelly Ayotte ""voted again yesterday against a proposal to expand background checks -- (buyers) can continue to simply go online or to gun shows to purchase guns without background checks."" In 2013, Ayotte voted against the bi-partisan Manchin-Toomey amendment that sought to expand checks for firearms purchased online and at gun shows. On June 20, Ayotte voted against a Democrat-sponsored amendment that similarly sought to expand background checks. Both times, Ayotte instead voted for a different amendment that would have strengthened the current system, but did not expand background checks to cover firearms sales at gun shows or over the Internet, two things cited by Hassan.

"Says Nevada lawmakers voted to allow teenaged boys to ""shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms.""",GOP campaign mail severely distorts complex issue of transgender bathroom access.,"Several Republican state Assembly hopefuls are using campaign mail pieces to try and tie Nevada lawmakers to the debate surrounding bathroom access for transgender students. One such ad by Assembly candidate Steve Sanson depicts Assembly Majority Leader Paul Anderson  looming over a bathroom stall , with overlaid text reading: ""Now teenaged boys can shower with your teenaged girls in public school locker rooms."" Another from Assembly hopeful Blaine Jones depicts his primary opponent, Assemblyman Derek Armstrong,  peering over a bathroom stall  and implying that the Republican supports transgender bathrooms. Given recent headlines over bathroom access for transgender students, we thought it was worth checking into how Nevada deals with the issue. Legislative flashback Nevada lawmakers did tackle a bill in 2015 that would have required all students to use the bathroom that corresponded to their biological sex. After  heated debate , Assembly members voted down the  proposed bill  with  five Republicans  (including freshman Armstrong, another mailer target) breaking rank and joining Democrats to defeat the measure. But the mailers themselves appear to be referring to another bill,  SB504 , which established a  statewide anti-bullying program  and was  approved  by all but a handful of legislators. The  vast majority  of that specific bill dealt with setting up a new statewide anti-bullying office and setting stricter requirements for reporting and investigating bullying. Several activists seized upon a 2015  legislative briefing  released by the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom, which interpreted the new law as creating a ""new right"" for transgender students to access the bathrooms and shower rooms of their choice. In an  endorsement letter , Assemblyman Ira Hansen said the new law ""mandated every school district in Nevada make all facilities âgender neutral.â"" But the law itself isnât that clear-cut. A tangled legal web A mandate on bathroom access for transgender students is part of an ongoing legal debate that still doesnât have a clear answer. UNLV law professor Ann McGinley says several federal courts have issued rulings indicating that transgender students fit under Title IX protections for gender equality, but any finality on a federal level will likely come from a future Supreme Court decision. McGinley says the question then falls to the state level, where the law is unclear. Thereâs nothing in state law that specifically mandates transgender students have the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with, but Republican Gov. Brian Sandovalâs office says the issue is essentially settled through the stateâs broadly focused anti-discrimination laws. Lawmakers in 2011  expanded  the stateâs anti-discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression. Because these ""public accommodation"" laws cover "" place(s) of education ,"" presumably school districts canât segregate transgender students from using the gendered bathroom they identify with without violating state law. ""No change in policy is necessary and the Obama administration has no need to have concerns about Nevada schools,"" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin said in an earlier statement. So how does the anti-bullying bill â SB504 â fit into the debate? Nestled in the bill are several new definitions of bullying, including ""blocking access to any property or facility of a school."" The Alliance Defending Freedom brief uses that definition, along with the addition of gender identity or expression into classes protected by the legislation, to argue that it creates a "" new right "" for transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Sanson, one of the ""insurgent Republicans"" running against Anderson, referred to the ADF brief in  several   blog  posts on his website, which also included letters from Assembly members  Hansen  and  Shelly Shelton . ""President Obama recently federally mandated all locker-rooms and bathrooms be designated âgender-neutralâ, but it was already Nevada law because of Andersonâs leadership,"" Hansen said in a letter. Anderson called the brief ""irrelevant"" in an interview with PolitiFact. He said the legislation itself was designed to create general anti-bullying guidelines and that the billâs language was left intentionally vague. ""The goal was to create a vague definition so that school districts could apply their own policies,"" he said. ""To spin it in any other way is frankly disingenuous,"" he added. McGinley says defining the law as creating a ""new right"" is probably too broad, but itâs possible the new anti-bullying legislation creates additional legal standing in the event a school district is challenged in court over their policies around transgender students. Thatâs similar to how the Nevada branch of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to tackle the issue, according to the groupâs policy director Holly Welborn. She said the ACLU has received several complaints related to transgender student bathroom access, but any lawsuit brought by the civil liberties group would likely stand on the already-existing public accommodation laws. ""It (SB504) certainly isnât creating a new right, itâs a right that already exists,"" Welborn said. Different statewide standards Transgender student access to bathrooms and other school facilities is largely dependent on individual policies of school districts. The Obama administration used transgender student policy of the Washoe County School District in Reno as an  example of best practices  for other school districts to follow. The district approved  regulations last year  allowing students to ""use facilities that correspond to their gender identity as expressed by the student and asserted at school"" including access to locker rooms. Itâs a different case in the rural Elko County, where in 2015 one transgender studentâs  request to use male-designated school facilities  was rejected by the local school board (requiring the student to use unisex bathrooms instead). Elko school district officials told  a local newspaper  that they interpreted the Obama administrationâs letter as a ""political statement"" and would continue to make decisions on transgender student access on a case-by-case basis. But the  vast majority  of Nevadaâs students are in the Clark County School District (in Las Vegas), which has yet to approve district-wide regulations for transgender students. The district circulated an internal draft in 2014 that would have set a more defined policy for transgender student equal access, but it was never made public. Despite a board memberâs  2015 request for clarity , the district has yet to approve any  policy changes  for transgender student access, instead making decisions on a  case-by-case  basis. District spokeswoman Michelle Booth said efforts to adopt a policy are ongoing. ""The Clark County School District has received the âLetter to Colleaguesâ from the U.S. Department of Education and is currently studying the details closely to determine what if any changes we will have to make to remain in compliance with federal guidelines,"" she said in an emailed statement. McGinley said the uncertainty on federal and state levels means thereâs no clear evidence of a mandate on allowing transgender students the right to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. ""Each county and school district are making these determinations based on how much risk theyâre willing to take,"" she said. Our ruling Several Republican Assembly candidates are claiming that legislators are forcing ""boys to shower with girls."" Putting aside questions about the nature of gender, these ads just arenât accurate. They refer to a piece of legislation that mostly deals with creating new anti-bullying policies. There is no clearly defined mandate in Nevada state law regarding transgender student access to bathrooms and locker rooms, and school districts around the state have very different standards county-to-county. Given the likelihood of future litigation on both a federal and state level, itâs misleading to connect a vaguely worded anti-bullying bill to the much more complicated area of transgender student rights. We rate these ads False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5b783899-a799-4b5e-be8a-eae37ab688f1",6/13/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jun/13/nevada-assembly-republican-candidates/gop-campaign-mail-severely-distorts-complex-issue-/,1,,
"Says Ron Johnson voted to turn Medicare ""into a voucher program.""","Sen. Ron Johnson voted for Paul Ryan plans to make Medicare a voucher program, Democratic Party says.","In 2011, after the U.S. House of Representatives approved a federal budget pushed by Wisconsin Republican  Paul Ryan , Democrats repeatedly claimed that Republicans had ""voted to end Medicare."" That became PolitiFact Nationalâs  Lie of the Year . Ryan, now the House speaker, has continued to advance Medicare reform proposals. And now the  Wisconsin Democratic Party  is making an attack -- though with a claim that doesnât go nearly as far as the lie of the year. In a  radio ad  released May 4, 2016, the party said GOP U.S. Sen.  Ron Johnson  ""went after Medicare, voting to turn it into a voucher program."" Itâs an attack that is likely to be repeated as Democrat  Russ Feingold  seeks to take back the Senate seat from Johnson in the November 2016 election. So, did Johnson vote to make Medicare ""a voucher program""? Thereâs some argument over semantics between voucher and premium supports, a term preferred by Republicans. But the answer is: Pretty much. Paul Ryan budgets To back its claim, the state Democratic party cited Johnsonâs votes for Ryanâs budget proposals, which included the Medicare reforms. Those budgets, which did not become law, prompted Democrats to charge that Ryan wanted to turn Medicare into a voucher program. Our colleagues have consistently  rated   those   claims   Mostly   True . As PolitiFact National has  explained : The initial Ryan plan using the term premium supports was released in early 2011. Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums. It would have affected people who at the time were under 55. Ryan then updated versions of the plan, including one as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. That newer version would have allowed beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they could use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.  So, the main point is that  Medicare would change  from paying fees to doctors and hospitals, and instead beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy toward their coverage. Thatâs a big change. Johnsonâs campaign argues that the change wouldnât be a voucher and emphasizes that what RepublicansÂ callÂ premium support payments would be made to insurance companies, not to Medicare beneficiaries themselves. Our colleagues concluded that, although there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports that may matter to health policy professionals, the two definitions have become almost indistinguishable and voucher program is a fair description for what Ryan proposed. Our rating The state Democratic Party says Johnson voted to turn Medicare ""into a voucher program."" To some health policy experts, there are technical differences between voucher and premium supports -- the latter term being preferred by Johnson and other Republicans when it comes to Medicare changes. But under Ryanâs proposals, Medicare would no longer pay fees to health care providers -- instead, Medicare beneficiaries would get a fixed subsidy to use toward their health care.

"Says Sen. John McCain ""told dreamers that heâll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it.""","Did John McCain support the Dream Act, then vote against it?","U.S. Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick says Sen. John McCain has changed after 33 years in Washington, D.C. On immigration, she said of her U.S. Senate rival, McCainâs changes are especially striking. ""He told dreamers that heâll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it,"" Kirkpatrick, D-Flagstaff, said in a  May 8 interview  with Al Sharpton on MSNBC. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (Dream) Act would have  allowed  undocumented children brought to the United States permanent resident status if they, among other provisions, completed two years of college or military service. We wondered if McCain really flipped his position on the Dream Act, as Kirkpatrick claimed. We found that McCainâs stance shifted slightly over more than a decade, but that does not equate to a cut-and-dried flip-flop. McCainâs voting record About a decade ago, McCain supported versions of the Dream Act. He even co-sponsored the  2003  and  2005  versions of the Dream Act, neither of which came to a vote. He did not sponsor the  2007 version  of the bill. He also didnât vote on it. McCain was campaigning for the Republican nomination for president. One of his opponents, Fred Thompson, had derided the legislation as "" stealth amnesty ."" When the bill came up again in December 2010, McCain voted against it. The legislation eventually failed after a 55-41  vote  in the Senate. What changed? Responding to conservative criticism, McCain stopped pushing for the Dream Act â unless it came with border security. Beefing up the border In  November 2007 , a month after his skipped vote on the 2007 Dream Act, McCain told the  Myrtle Beach Sun-News  that he would ""vote against anything unless we secured the borders."" A few months later in  February 2008 , McCain told the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., that ""it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first."" He did not mention the Dream Act in his remarks. After his ""nay"" vote on the legislation in 2010, the senior senator said  in a statement  that he had ""great sympathy"" for the affected students, but he couldnât put their needs above law-abiding Americans. ""There simply isn't sufficient political support to do anything before we secure our borders,"" McCain said, ""and there wonât be until we do."" What Kirkpatrick told Sharpton mimics an attack ad her campaign posted earlier in May.  The ad  claims McCain ""has been on every side of immigration"" and appears to show two clips of the Arizona senator speaking out both for and against the Dream Act. Kirkpatrickâs campaign spokesman provided a clip of  McCainâs remarks  at an immigration council in San Diego in July 2008 during McCainâs bid for the White House. In the clip, a young woman asks McCain if he would support ""our Dream Act."" McCain said "" yes, yes.""  Left unmentioned in Kirkpatrickâs talking point is how he also said existing laws needed to be enforced. ""Yes. Yes. Thank you. But I will also enforce the existing laws of a country. And a nationâs first requirement is the nationâs security, and thatâs why we have to have our borders secured. But we can have a way and a process of people obtaining citizenship in this country. And we cannot penalize people who come here legally and people who wait legally. And so thatâs a fundamental principle on which we have to operate."" The campaign then contrasts that with McCainâs vote in 2010. Â  McCainâs campaign spokeswoman pointed out that the senior senator co-sponsored the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration bill, which included a pathway to citizenship that included the Dream Act and also included provisions for  border security . He voted  yes . The Dream Act portion of the bill, which House Republicans  refused to conference  after it passed in the Senate, would have created a  five-year path  to documentation for immigrants, as long as they met requirements such as having a GED or high school diploma. Our ruling Kirkpatrick said, ""McCain told dreamers that heâll support the Dream Act, then he voted against it.â"" Her statement leaves out important context. McCainâs views has shifted on the Dream Act, but his waning support hasnât been the complete flip-flop Kirkpatrick makes it out to be. He did vote against the 2010 Dream Act, years after introducing similar measures in the Senate. But he supported the Dream Act in some form after the vote. He voted yes on the 2013 comprehensive immigration legislation that included pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought here as children from other countries. McCain made border security the priority before getting a Dream Act.

"Says North Carolina Rep. Renee Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against ""an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants.""",George Holding accuses Renee Ellmers of breaking party ranks on controversial immigration vote.,"In their first debate, three candidates for the Republican nomination for North Carolinaâs U.S. House District 2 squared off last week on who deserves to represent the area in Washington, D.C. The district was recently redrawn to include most of the suburban Wake County areas around Raleigh as well as all or part of the more rural Harnett, Johnston, Wilson, Nash and Franklin counties. In an oddity created by the new boundaries, two of the primary candidates are incumbents now fighting for the same seat. Throughout the debate, Rep. George Holding attempted to paint himself as a staunch conservative who wonât budge on controversial issues. Rep. Renee Ellmers attempted to paint herself as a more pragmatic conservative who would rather get things done. That fight was perhaps most apparent in a back-and-forth on immigration policy. Holding accused Ellmers of being too liberal in a 2015 vote. ""We had an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants,"" Holding said. ""Mrs. Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against that amendment."" Itâs true that Ellmers was  the only Republican to vote no  on that particular amendment, which was tacked onto a bill regarding Department of Homeland Security funding. She was also one of 10 Republicans  who voted against the bill as a whole . However, the amendment in question did more than just prioritize the deportation of dangerous sexual criminals. It also wouldâve prioritized people convicted of domestic violence or less serious, misdemeanor sexual crimes. And it was because of fears over unintended consequences of those   extra provisions â which Holding neglected to mention â that Ellmers has long said she voted no. Immediately after the 2015 vote, Ellmers said in an interview with McClatchyâs D.C. bureau that she opposed it because it ""may remove protections for victims of sexual assault or domestic abuse."" That was the same stance taken by the  National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence  and the  U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops . Both groups urged a âNoâ vote, saying the amendment would lead to domestic and sexual violence going unreported. ""Victims of domestic violence often do not seek help when they know that the consequences to the perpetrator (for example, a spouse or parent, or perhaps other family member) may result in the perpetratorâs deportation,"" the task force wrote to members of Congress. ""This often takes place due to their financial dependence, and even close relationship to the perpetrator."" The bishops agreed, writing: ""While presented as a measure that helps domestic violence victims, we fear that it actually would discourage many such victims from reporting abuse."" The amendment and the bill as a whole passed the House despite that opposition. But the amendment in question was removed by the Senate, which passed the bill and sent the new version back to the House, which approved it even though it didnât include the amendment. President Obama then signed the bill into law. That chain of events led Ellmers, during the recent debate, to shoot back at Holding. ""That amendment was completely meaningless, and you know it was,"" she said. And even though Holding brought up sexual criminals, the amendment would have changed nothing for the most egregious offenders. Undocumented immigrants who commit felonies â including serious sexual crimes like rape â were already given top priority for deportation. Ellmers referenced that in the debate: ""As far as deporting those who are the worst offenders â those illegal immigrants who are pedophiles â my goodness, are we not doing that now?"" It was a rhetorical question. But according to the government, we are indeed doing just that. In 2014, the Department of Homeland Security listed its highest priorities for deportation: convicted of a felony, convicted of gang-related crimes, caught at the border or suspected of being a terrorist or spy. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) report on the 2015 fiscal year said 98 percent of the 235,413 people deported that year met one of its criteria or were otherwise considered a threat to public safety. At the debate, Ellmers also said she voted no because she thought Republicans should have worked with Democrats to find a compromise instead of letting President Obama set the countryâs immigration policy while Congress remains in a boondoggle. ""I find it interesting that we are still in a place where we are having this conversation about what we are not getting done,"" Ellmers said. Our ruling Holding said Ellmers was the only Republican to vote against ""an amendment to prioritize the deportation of sexual criminals who are illegal immigrants."" Holding was correct about Ellmersâ conspicuous break from party ranks. But his description of the amendment was a bit misleading, since anyone convicted of a felony for a sex crime was already prioritized for deportation. Ellmers has also long said she voted against the bill due to fears that it would lead to less reporting of domestic violence. Thatâs a key piece of context that was missing from Holdingâs assessment of her record.

"""Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community.""",Julian Castro claims Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect a hate group.,"Housing Secretary JuliÃ¡n Castro, a surrogate for Hillary Clintonâs presidential campaign,  took aim  at Bernie Sandersâ record on immigration during the senatorâs former elected capacity as an Independent member of the U.S. House from 1991 to 2007. Sanders ""voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community,"" Castro, a former San Antonio mayor, said in a statement rolled out by the Clinton camp March 8, 2016, the day that Sen. Sanders of Vermont  won an upset victory  in the partyâs Michigan presidential primary. Clinton leveled a similar claim about Sanders and the Minutemen at a Democratic debate in Miami the next day;  PolitiFact found her statement Mostly True.  Unlike Castro, she did not call the Minuteman Project a hate group. Democrats tend to support comprehensive immigration reform including possible citizenship for residents living in the country without legal permission. Sanders, an Independent, caucused with Democrats in the House and later in the Senate. So itâs arguably not helpful at the polls for him to be seen as supporting the Minuteman Project, which came into the spotlight in 2005 when its founders organized a volunteer stakeout of parts of the Arizona-Mexico border for the month of April. One of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, Chris Simcox, parted ways with the project and established the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps in 2005. The remaining founder, Jim Gilchrist, was fired from the Minuteman Project in 2007,  according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.  The groups spawned a network of chapters over the years, driven by a combination of growth and internal conflict over finances and other issues. Some chapters were not close to the border and focused on anti-immigration advocacy, while others voluntarily patrolled the U.S.-side of the border with Mexico. Those patrols and confrontation with undocumented immigrants prompted then-President George W. Bush to disparage them as  ""vigilantes""  Â and a former Mexican president to call them ""immigrant hunters,""  the Washington Post reported in 2005 . But the Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps websites in 2005 and 2006 explicitly  described their cause as ""peaceful""  and  urged members to follow the letter of the law  while patrolling the border, or risk discrediting their cause. In the claim, Castro, like Clinton, was referencing a vote on an amendment to a 2006 appropriations bill. The amendment was proposed by Rep. Jack Kingston of Georgia in response to rumors that the U.S. Border Patrol had been telling the Mexican government where vigilante civilian border groups were stationed. The 2006  CQ Almanac  described it as follows : ""Kingston, R-Ga., amendment that would bar the use of funds in the bill to provide a foreign government with information that relates to the operations or location of the Minutemen or other private volunteer border patrol groups along the U.S.-Mexican border, unless the information sharing is required by an international treaty."" On the House floor,  Kingston explained , ""What this amendment does is it clarifies Congress' position on a Border Patrol practice or a practice of the U.S. Government that tips off illegal immigrants as to where citizen patrols may be located. ... What my amendment does is simply says that the U.S. Government cannot tip off the Mexican officials as to where these folks are located."" At the time, Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., said he didnât oppose it because it essentially restated existing Customs and Border Patrol policy. PolitiFact found that Clinton got Sandersâ vote right â he did vote with the GOP for the amendment,  House records show  â but downplayed what had been a bipartisan vote where 76 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in support. But unlike Clinton, Castro described the   Minuteman Project as ""a hate group."" So, is the Minuteman Project a hate group â and did Sandersâ vote really protect them? Requests for clarification from Castro led to Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, reaching out via email and directing us to the Southern Poverty Law Centerâs list of  nativist extremist groups . Â The SPLC was established in 1971 and is listed as an outreach partner   by the FBI, according to the agencyâs website. The SPLC list   doesnât designate the Minuteman Project a hate group, unlike some other groups on their list of nativist extremists, which are marked with an asterisk to denote that they are both nativist extremist and hate groups. We wondered what moves a group into hate-group territory. By phone, Mark Potok, a center expert, told us ""the nativist extremist groups are a step towards the center."" ""Basically, those are the groups which go beyond merely disagreeing with immigration policy and confront, personally, suspected illegal immigrants, or people who would help or hire them,"" he said, adding: ""We don't list a group just for saying they think immigration levels ought to be lower."" Potok continued, ""the thing to understand about our hate group listing is it's not based on criminality or violence. Itâs based on the ideology expressed by the group, on its website or by its leaders. We ask, does it demonize an entire group? Those are the hardest line groups we cover."" The SPLCâs website  defines  hate groups as those that ""have beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people, typically for their immutable characteristics."" Potok said that in 2006, the year the vote Castro referenced took place, nativist extremist groups were on the rise after beginning to emerge around 2005.   Activity   peaked in 2010, he said, when the center tallied 319 groups. In 2015, the SPLC counted only 17 such groups . ""A lot of these [extremist nativist groups] were spinoffs of the Minutemen groups,"" Potok said, ""but not all."" Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, said in a phone interview that Jim Gilchrist, one of the co-founders of the Minuteman Project, was receptive when Levin approached him to deal with neo-Nazi elements in the organization, and that differences of opinion on how to handle that issue contributed to the fissure creating the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. ""Certainly there were entities in the border movement that were clearly racist hate groups, and certainly there were people who were in the Minuteman Project at the time who were, but I can tell you that [Jim] Gilchrist wanted those people excluded, and after I informed him, he took measures to do,"" he said. In our research, we found that coverage of the projectâs offshoots has been dominated by several high-profile criminal cases that happened in the years between 2006 and today. In 2009, a former member of the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps murdered a Latino man and his 9-year-old daughter after breaking into their home,  CNN reported . In 2013, Minuteman Project and Minuteman Civil Defense Corps co-founder Chris Simcox was arrested for child sexual molestation,  according to Univision . These incidents have taken a toll on the reputation of the groups (for instance, in 2010, the NAACP referred to the Minuteman Project as ""a nativist organization that has in the past been associated with the murder of migrant Mexican workers as part of its vigilante ""border operations""). But it doesn't make sense to judge Sandersâ House vote on incidents that came after it occurred. So what information on the project was available at the time of the vote? A report from the Congressional Research Service, dated April 7, 2006, cited many  potential  problems that could arise with civilian border patrols, but also said that ""apart from the widely reported incident involving Ranch Rescue [an extremist anti-immigration group that dressed in military gear and went looking for armed drug smugglers in 2002], there have been no credible reports of civilian border patrol organizations engaging in violence against migrants."" Some scholars of the Minuteman Project, like Leo Chavez, an anthropologist at UC Irvine who has written about the group,  have suggested  that press coverage and creating a spectacle were central to the groupâs purpose (""Although monitoring the U.S.- Mexico border was Gilchristâs immediate objective, the larger goal was to use the ""citizen patrols"" on the border to draw attention to Gilchristâs larger aim of influencing public opinion and federal immigration policy,"" he wrote). Christopher J. Walker, an associate professor of law at Ohio Stateâs Moritz College of Law, echoed this view in an article in the Harvard Latino Law Review,  writing , ""More than anything else, the Minutemen seek media attention."" Todd Gutnick, communications director for the Anti-Defamation League, told us by email, ""We have always referred to the Minutemen Project (of that period) as anti-immigrant extremists, who had racists/haters in their rank and file, but not specifically a hate group,"" when asked about the ADLâs view of the Project circa 2006. Sanders campaign policy director Warren Gunnels told us by email that Sanders ""did not vote to protect the minuteman. This amendment simply stated what was already law at that time. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has never shared information with the Mexican government except when required by treaty."" Although Sabo said it didnât reflect a change in existing law, 106 out of 201 Democrats at the time still voted against it; 19 did not vote. We reached out to Kingston for his perspective on the amendment. ""It wasnât an extremist group, they werenât violent, they werenât making threats, it wasnât anything like that at all,"" he said by phone. ""It passed overwhelmingly. I may have spoken to Bernie about it at the time, I donât remember, but it wasnât an extremist position. To me, it was common sense."" ""It was a minor vote. Iâve gotten calls from a few other reporters that started a few months ago. I didnât even remember the thing itself until they started asking me about it,"" he said. Our attempts to reach the Minuteman Project by phone and via its website proved unsuccessful. Our ruling Castro, a surrogate for the Clinton campaign, said: ""Bernie Sanders voted with Republicans to protect the Minutemen, a hate group that used military tactics against our community."" Sanders, then an Independent in the House, voted with 75 Democrats to restrict the U.S. from alerting Mexico to Minutemen operations on the border. However, we didnât see any evidence that this since-weakened extremist group was designated a ""hate group."" On balance, we rate this claim as Half True.

"Kelly Ayotte ""has voted to defund Planned Parenthood"" six times.",Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte has record of voting to defund Planned Parenthood.,"Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces a competitive reelection bid in New Hampshire and Democrats are already taking aim at her record on abortion and womenâs health. Gov. Maggie Hassan, the only Democratic candidate in the race, is one of the latest to lob those criticisms. ""She has voted to defund Planned Parenthood, which provides healthcare to about 12,000 Granite State women,"" Hassan said in a recent interview with the Concord Monitor, referring to Ayotte. ""Sheâs voted to defund them six times."" Planned Parenthood, a womenâs health care provider that also offers abortions, has become a lightning rod in recent years as elected officials in Washington and in New Hampshire have taken steps to cut the organizationâs funding. The organization is no fan of Ayotte: Planned Parenthoodâs political arm took out its  first ad of the 2016 cycle this month  targeting New Hampshireâs junior Senator. We decided to take a closer look at Hassanâs claim. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England runs five health centers across New Hampshire -- in Manchester, Claremont, Derry, Exeter and Keene. And roughly half of the patients who visit a Planned Parenthood clinic across the border in Vermont -- in White River Junction -- are from New Hampshire. The Planned Parenthood centers in New Hampshire all provide contraception, annual exams, STI testing and treatment, and pregnancy testing. The Manchester location, which saw 4,779 patients in 2014, provides surgical and medical abortions. The Keene location, visited by 1,871 patients in 2014, offers medication abortions, according to Kayla McCarthy, with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England. Altogether Planned Parenthood clinics in New Hampshire served just over 11,000 patients during 2014, according according to Vice President for Public Policy Jennifer Frizzell. Another 1,750 were seen in the White River Junction, VT clinic. That would mean Planned Parenthood clinics together saw roughly 12,000 New Hampshire patients in 2014, in line with Hassanâs claim. Now letâs look at how many times Ayotte has voted against Planned Parenthood funding. Ayotte, elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, has been a consistent opponent of abortion and critic of Planned Parenthood. We checked with Hassanâs campaign and they pointed us to six votes. Three votes took place all on the same day, Dec. 3, 2015. 1) That day the Senate  voted 52-47  to block federal funding to Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act in one bill.  Ayotte voted for it.  2) Ayotte voted  against  an amendment that would have stripped a provision from the bill to defund Planned Parenthood. (The amendment  was defeated .) 3) Another amendment,  proposed by Democrats , sought to continue federal funding for Planned Parenthood, but it was tabled (that is, set aside) and Ayotte  voted  in favor of tabling it. (President Obama ultimately vetoed the bill.) 4)  Ayotte voted to advance  a bill last August that sought to prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood. But the legislation failed to get the 60 votes it needed to move forward. 5) Ayotte voted in April 2011 for  a resolution  to  prohibit federal dollars  from funding Planned Parenthood. It failed,  42 to 58.  6) And in March 2011 Ayotte voted for a bill to fund the federal government, that included dozens of other spending items, but blocked federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The bill failed, 44 to 56. Ayotte said at the time: ""Our country is in a fiscal crisisâ¦ Everyone is going to have to make sacrifices, including many private organizations that have relied on federal resources,"" according to her office. In all, these six votes show some level opposition to funding for Planned Parenthood. However, some of them were procedural, and not all offered a clean up-or-down funding decision, as Hassanâs statement suggests. Â  Ayotteâs office said she supported several other government spending bills that did not defund Planned Parenthood. And in September 2015, Ayotte  voted not to move  forward with a temporary government spending bill that sought to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Ayotte said at the time she supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but didnât want to shut the government down to do it. ""Kelly Ayotte has voted to direct federal funding away from Planned Parenthood in an effort to better use federal dollars to fill gaps in women's health services for low-income women and preserve access to womenâs health services,"" spokeswoman Liz Johnson said. Our ruling Hassan said Ayotte voted six times to defund Planned Parenthood. Ayotte has been a consistent critic of Planned Parenthood and has shown support for defunding the organization or opposition to continued funding in at least six votes. Itâs worth noting that some were procedural votes and several were much larger bills that included a provision on Planned Parenthood funding. Hassanâs claim is accurate, but needs clarification. We rate her statement Mostly True. Â Â Â ",4/29/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/apr/29/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-has-record-voting-/,1,,
"""Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act.""",Maggie Hassan says Kelly Ayotte repeatedly voted against Paycheck Fairness Act.,"The contention -- and the number -- seemed startling. On Equal Pay Day, Democrats said Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte had not only voted against equal paychecks for women, but she had done so multiple times. Both Governor Maggie Hassan, who is challenging Ayotte for her Senate seat,  and   the New Hampshire Democratic Party , blasted Ayotte in dual press releases on April 12, 2016. ""It is extremely troubling that Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help ensure that women can earn equal pay for equal work.""  Hassan said in the release . Ayotte  also put out out a statement  about equal pay on the same day in April, which is the date that women, on average, have to work into the following year to make as much as men. In 2016, that date was April 12. Given that Ayotte has sponsored and promoted her own bill calling for equal pay, called the GAP Act, we decided to check it out. About the bill The bill in question is called the Paycheck Fairness Act, which  according to its official legislative description  ""amends the portion of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) known as the Equal Pay Act to revise remedies for, enforcement of, and exceptions to prohibitions against sex discrimination in the payment of wages."" Perhaps the strongest tool in the bill is the provision to ""make employers who violate sex discrimination prohibitions liable in a civil action for damages."" This language has inspired the most Republican opposition, including from Ayotte. She believes it exposes employers to frivolous lawsuits and other problematic litigation and could restrict merit pay, among other reasons, according to her office. She has therefore voted for a number of amendments and alternatives to the largely Democratic-backed bill. Sheâs currently supporting a piece of legislation called the GAP act, which Â ""makes it clear that employers must pay women and men equal wages for equal work, while still preserving the ability to award merit pay and allow for flexible schedules,"" Ayotte and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito  wrote in an op-ed for the Concord  Monitor . The issue has  taken on special resonance  in Ayotteâs Senate re-election race, since sheâs facing off against New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, who supports the act. The votes So letâs look at the four votes. Hassanâs campaign and the state party pointed them out to us. (The same votes were  mentioned in an April 12 press release from EMILYâs list , a group that seeks to elect pro-abortion-rights women running as Democrats.) The votes were held on June 5, 2012; April 9, 2014; Sept. 15, 2014; and March 24, 2015. The first three were procedural votes, known as cloture. These are votes meant to cut off debate on a bill and bring it to the floor of the Senate for a vote. While an actual bill can pass with a simple majority in the U.S. Senate, it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture, meaning that as a practical matter, Senate passage requires a bill to have 60 votes rather than just a simple majority. Republicans often refuse to end debate on bills favored by Democrats, and vice versa. So, although Ayotte opposed the bill being debated and has said so repeatedly in public, itâs not entirely accurate -- at least in three of these cases -- to say that she voted against the paycheck bill itself. She was casting a procedural vote in these three cases, which is not exactly the same as up or down votes on the legislation. In addition, the final vote listed by the Democrats was for an  amendment offered by Sen. Barbara Mikulski  addressing the issue. Ayotte voted against the amendment, though she did vote for  an alternative Republican amendment . The biggest omission by Hassanâs camp   is leaving out  a vote from Sept. 10, 2014 , when Ayotte actually called for ending debate on equal pay legislation. She was one of 73 -- including a number of Republicans -- to cast votes doing so. According to her office, Ayotte hoped to change the bill but was denied the ability to do so by Harry Reid. Our ruling Hassan said that ""Kelly Ayotte has voted four times against the federal Paycheck Fairness Act."" Hassan glosses over some nuances -- most of the votes were procedural rather than substantive, and she leaves out a vote in which Ayotte cast a procedural vote in favor of advancing the bill. And itâs worth noting that Ayotteâs opposition to the bill doesnât mean sheâs an opponent of equal pay for women; rather, she and most Republicans have a substantive disagreement over the means to that end. Still, Hassan made her assertion specific -- Ayotteâs record on this particular piece of legislationÂ -- and itâs clear that Ayotte has a longstanding record of opposing this bill. We rate the claim Mostly True.",4/29/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/apr/29/maggie-hassan/maggie-hassan-says-kelly-ayotte-repeatedly-voted-a/,1,,
"Says he ""was the only Republican"" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood.",U.S. Rep. David Jolly says he voted against House Planned Parenthood investigation.,"Seeking Marco Rubioâs soon-to-be-vacant Senate seat, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said during a debate in Orlando that heâs committed to sticking to conservative principles, even if it means voting against his own party. Jolly met with U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, at an  Open Debate Coalition event on April 25, 2016 , to discuss the Senate candidatesâ platforms. After a question about whether he would support defending or defunding Planned Parenthood, Jolly said he opposed abortion and could not support the group, which has been under fire after being accused of selling fetal tissue. But he acknowledged other womenâs health services deserved funding and decried government wasting too much time and money on attacking Planned Parenthood. ""When my side of the aisle asked for an investigation of Planned Parenthood, I actually voted no. I was the only Republican to vote no,"" he said. ""Should the issue be looked at? Yes. But there were already three committees looking at the issue. We didnât need a fourth. Weâre either going to be the party of less government or not."" Technically, the investigation Jolly is talking about doesnât mention Planned Parenthood by name, but the Indian Shores Republican was the lone member of his party to oppose it. Copious committees The Republican-controlled House responded swiftly after the Center for Medical Progress released their  heavily edited videos in July 2015  alleging Planned Parenthood sold fetal tissue after abortions. Â  The  Energy and Commerce Committee , the  Judiciary Committee  and the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee  all announced investigations into the videos on July 15. (The Senate also prodded theÂ  Health and Human Services Department to open an investigation , as well.) Despite several hearings, including testimony from  Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards , there was no proof the group broke the law, which  allows for tissue donations for an unspecified procurement fee  but not taxpayer funds for abortions. On Oct. 7, 2015, the House voted on  HR 451 , which  created a select investigative panel  ""for the purpose of investigating abortion practices and the handling of and policies regarding fetal tissue, its cost, and how it is obtained."" Planned Parenthood was not named in the resolution, but was clearly the target of the investigation. Jolly was the only Republican to go against his party in a 242-184 vote, with two Democrats voting for it. Jolly noted in a Facebook post after the vote that he did not believe the panel was necessary. ""We should always look to streamline government, not expand it. And the bottom line is today's decision unfortunately fails that most basic conservative principle,"" he said, according toÂ the  Tampa Bay Times . ""Simply put, because three panels currently have jurisdiction to investigate, we do not need to create a fourth."" We couldnât find the post when we looked at Jollyâs  Facebook timeline . His campaign directed us to a  similarly worded Newsmax article  Jolly wrote on Oct. 14, 2015. The article highlighted  legislation Jolly introduced  ""to fully defund taxpayer support for Planned Parenthood until a thorough investigation is completed, and instead transfer that funding to other providers of critical non-abortion women's healthcare in underserved communities."" Investigations by 12 state governments did not find any evidence of fetal tissue sales, although a grand jury in Texas in February 2016 did  indict David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt , who made the videos. They both face charges of tampering with a government record, while Center for Medical Progress founder Daleiden was charged with prohibition of the purchase and sale of human organs. The panel the House created in October, the  Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives , has  held hearings  but has not yet asked Daleiden to testify. Our ruling Jolly said he ""was the only Republican"" to vote against creating a House panel to investigate Planned Parenthood. The reason he voted no, he said, is because the House already had three investigations into Planned Parenthoodâs alleged sale of fetal tissue. Jolly made it clear at the time he was not in favor of spending more taxpayer dollars to investigate something already under the microscope.

"Says Erv Nelson voted ""yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urgingÂ Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country.""",Immigration debate enters key Nevada state Senate race.,"The federal immigration debate is turning into a down-ballot issue in Nevada. Assembly freshmen Erv Nelson and Victoria Seaman are entwined in an ugly Republican primary battle for a critical state Senate seat that holds the potential to tip the balance in the 11-10 Republican-controlled state Senate. Seaman has  relentlessly attacked Nelson , and one of her campaign flyers accuses him of supporting a ""pro-amnesty"" immigration bill. ""Why did Erv Nelson vote yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country?"" Â  Because immigration is an important topic in Nevada â a state with a "" top share of unauthorized immigrants "" â we wanted to fact-check this claim. The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015:  Senate Joint Resolution 21 . Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted ""no."" It passed unanimously in the Senate. The only Assembly member to comment on the resolutionâs passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a ""warm and fuzzy feel-good bill"" only to be used for ""political benefit"" in future elections. ""Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21,"" she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015. The resolution is straightforward. Itâs little more than  two pages  listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include ""earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship."" It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in  2013 . So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution ""pro-amnesty"" is harder to prove. In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seamanâs campaign sent a  two-page letter  arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as ""citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people."" Use of the word ""amnesty"" in immigration policy is contentious, and thereâs no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used. PolitiFact did look into use of the word ""amnesty"" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obamaâs proposed immigration policies in  2011  and  2012 , but itâs much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015. In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law. Itâs true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as ""amnesty"", but the resolution is just so vague that itâs difficult to call it ""pro-amnesty."" A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politicallyÂ charged word is "" debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation ."" The resolution additionally doesnât really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, "" send a strong message to Congress "" to take up immigration reform. Nelson didnât answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community. Both lawmakers voted for a  successful measure  making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to  get a teacherâs license in Nevada . And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a  measure prohibiting  contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee. Ultimately, there just isnât a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of "" symbolic "" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as itâs almost entirely a federally managed issue. Nevada did approve  driver authorization cards  for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time. Itâs worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an  earlier committee  meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A  video of the meeting  is online, but itâs difficult to tell if sheâs present during the voice vote. That isnât necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seamanâs campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote. Our ruling Seaman says Nelson voted ""yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urgingÂ Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country."" To be clear, the ""bill"" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls forÂ a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly sayÂ it falls under the ""amnesty"" umbrella, and just doesnât mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate.

"Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland ""voted to uphold"" D.C.âs ban on handguns.",John Whitbeck misfires on Merrick Garland's gun record.,"Gun rights are ""hanging by a thread,"" Republican Party of Virginia chairman John Whitbeck wrote recently in an email urging the rejection of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. ""When Justice Antonin Scalia wrote his watershed opinion in D.C. v. Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote,"" Whitbeck wrote. ""Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights.  While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.âs draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them ,"" the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type. Whitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet  petition  telling Virginiaâs U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick ""must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!"" Scalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Courtâs landmark 2008 ruling on  District of Columbia vs. Heller . By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washingtonâs gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeckâs claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, ""voted to uphold"" the handgun ban. A  number  of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator  Bill OâReilly , have made similar statements. Â  The D.C. law  The Supreme Courtâs decision in Heller was   significant  because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individualâs right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case   went to the Supreme Court , though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges   came to the same conclusion  as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on Whitbeckâs claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didnât vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the   city of Washington asked the court  to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the courtâs judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up   denying the cityâs petition , but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case. Itâs misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is   generally used when  a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a   well-known conservative , joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an   amicus brief  asking the Supreme Court to send Heller   back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional. Â  ""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was  fact-checking  a statement by OâReilly. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" Our ruling Whitbeck said Garland ""voted to uphold"" D.C.âs ban on handguns. Garland never heard the case about Washingtonâs gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves. Garland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didnât sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc. Itâs simply inaccurate to say Garlandâs vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.âs gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nomineeâs position on the case.

"""After taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, (Debbie Wasserman Schultz) has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans.""",Debbie Wasserman Schultz attacked for bank donations and position on payday loan bill.,"A law professor running against U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida says she is in the pocket of big banks and isnât looking out for consumers who get crushed by debt from payday loans. ""My opponent, after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans,"" said Tim Canova on his  website . Canova, a first-time candidate and professor at Nova Southeastern University, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the August Democratic primary in a Broward/Miami-Dade district. The race has drawn national attention because Wasserman Schultz is the Democratic National Committee chair. Did Canova accurately describe her donations from banks and her votes related to payday loans and car loans? There is some truth to his attack, but each one requires explanation. Donations from Wall Street banks Canovaâs campaign pointed to donations from banks, securities/investment firms and finance/credit companies to Wasserman Schultzâs campaign committee and her political action committee, or PAC. At PolitiFact Floridaâs request, the Center for Responsive Politics compiled the large individual donations (more than $200) and donations to her PAC starting with her 2006 election. The center found she received $309,020 from commercial banks, which represented about 2 percent of the total; $408,450 from securities/investment firms, and $325,850 from finance/credit companies. Her leadership PAC, Democrats Win Seats, received donations from the Goldman Sachs PAC:  $5,000 in 2016  and  $10,000  in 2014. Wasserman SchultzÂ spokesmanÂ Sean BartlettÂ pointed to donations only to her campaign and plucked out what he said were the ""big bank"" donations. That totaled $15,400, including $4,000 from Goldman Sachs. But the Center for Responsive Politics shows a longer list of bank donations even if we only examine her campaign committee. It shows  $171,303 for ""commercial bank""  industry donations. Payday loan bill Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a  high rate  of interest. It is a controversial industry that targets the poor and is disproportionately located in minority communities. For years, payday loans were unregulated by the federal government, although some states had their own laws. President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating the industry when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have targeted the bureau for years. Enter some Democrats into the fray -- including Wasserman Schultz, whoÂ has gotten about $68,000 from payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wasserman Schultz is among Florida lawmakers who have defended Floridaâs payday law despite the fact that some consumer advocates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle. Wasserman Schultzâs position is to give precedence to the state law, her spokesman said. On the federal level, the bureau released an  outline of payday loan rules  in March 2015 and is expected to announce a more complete proposal within the next several months. Congress doesnât have to approve it but can introduce legislation to kill it. All but one member of Floridaâs congressional delegation (Tom Rooney) signed a  letter  in April 2015 pushing back against the proposed rules. Instead, they want the bureau to look at Floridaâs law as a model. That led U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, to file the ""Consumer Protection and Choice Act,""  H.R. 4018  in November. Half of the 24 cosponsors are from Florida, including Wasserman Schultz, and nine of the cosponsors are Democrats. Canovaâs website said Wasserman Schultz ""voted"" on the bill, but it was only referred to a committee without a vote. (After we pointed that out to CanovaÂ senior adviser Richard Bell, the campaign changed the website to say ""co-sponsored"" instead of ""voted."") The bill states that if the bureau determines that a stateâs law meets the federal requirements, then only state law will apply. It would also delay federal regulations for two years, which would allow states to come up with their own laws. More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a  letter  to Congress urging them to defeat the bill. They argued that the bill favors an ""industry-backed Florida law"" and would hurt consumers. Floridaâs 2001 payday loan law was a compromise and included protections that were intended to help the poor avoid an endless cycle of debt.Â But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lendingâs March  report . In the past year, the average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, disputed Rossâ description of Floridaâs law as the ""gold standard"" during a congressional hearing on March 16. In Florida, ""these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,"" Cordray  said . Bartlett argued that Wasserman Schultz has fought against ""abusive payday lending practices"" and pointed to her vote on a separate bill in 2015. She voted against HR 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which opponents argued would have prevented the Justice Department from going after the financial industry. Racial discrimination in car loans Canova also said Wasserman Schultz prevented action to stop racial discrimination for car loans. This part of Canovaâs attack relates to a  2013 bulletin  from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommended steps for auto lenders to avoid discrimination. The bulletin was intended to provide clarity about existing law. But the  House of Representatives  pushed back against the bureau by passing a bill to nullify the bulletin. The bill passed the House 332-96 in November 2015 and hasnât had a vote in the Senate. Wasserman Schultz was one of 88 Democrats who voted in favor of it, while 96 Democrats opposed it. Proponents  of the bill -- including auto dealers -- said the bureauâs efforts would increase costs for consumers. Groups that represented  minorities  wanted the new guidelines. ""This legislation in no way prevented the CFPB from addressing racial discrimination in car loans, and the congresswoman does not support that as a policy position,"" her spokesman said. The bill hasnât been acted on, and discrimination investigations canÂ continue. A few months after the House vote,  Toyota  agreed to a $21.9 million settlement to black and Asian buyers. Our ruling Canova says Wasserman Schultz ""after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans."" Her campaign committee and PAC have taken $309,020 from commercial banks since her re-election campaign in 2006 -- about 2 percent of the total. That includes $15,000 in donations from Goldman Sachs to her leadership PAC. The payday loan bill hasnât had a vote in the House yet, although Wasserman Schultz is a co-sponsor. The bill would not prevent the bureau from regulating payday loans entirely, but it would cede power to the states, including Florida, which has its own payday law that some advocates have criticized as weak. She voted for a bill that squashed bureau guidelines that were intended to provide clarity about the law on racial discrimination related to car loans.

"Says Supreme Court nominee Merrick GarlandÂ ""voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens.""",Bill O'Reilly wrongly says Merrick Garland voted to ban citizens from having guns in DC.,"Even if Republican senators agree to consider President Barack Obamaâs Supreme Court nominee, his record on gun rights alone will stop his confirmation,  says  Fox News host Bill OâReilly. On his show March 16, OâReilly acknowledged that Obamaâs pick â Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuitâ is ""not some crazy left-wing bomb thrower."" ""But he voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens, and the Supreme Court of course said no, that is unconstitutional,""  OâReilly added . ""But he voted to keep the guns away. Just that vote, and you must know this, alienates most in the Republican Party, so they never would vote to confirm him."" A few conservative  groups and figures have already attacked Garland for his position on guns since his nomination. Weâre putting OâReillyâs specific claim that Garland voted ""to keep guns away from private citizens"" on the Truth-O-Meter. D.C. gun ban OâReillyâs statement refers to a landmark case on gun rights,  District of Columbia vs. Heller .  In its 2008 ruling, the Supreme Court found that Washingtonâs gun regulations â essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home â were unconstitutional. This ruling was  significant  because it was the first time the court held that the Second Amendment guarantees an individualâs right to own a firearm for self defense. Up until  Heller , the widespread understanding of the Second Amendment was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case  went to the Supreme Court , though, it appeared in the federal court of appeals for the D.C. circuit, where Garland has been a judge since 1997, as  Parker vs. District of Columbia . In a 2-1 decision, a panel of three D.C. Circuit judges  came to the same conclusion  as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on OâReillyâs claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didnât vote on this case at all. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the  city of Washington asked the court  to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the courtâs judges would reconsider the case, not just the panel of three. The court ended up  denying the cityâs petition , but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who was in favor of rehearing the case. Itâs not fair to conclude that Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider the case, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is  generally used when  a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a  well-known conservative , joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual rights, filed an  amicus brief  to the Supreme Court asking them to send  Heller  back to the lower courts for consideration, noted Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School. ""Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law,"" Winkler said. ""Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment."" We should also note another case, which some critics say indicates that Garland has a left-leaning opinion of the Second Amendment. In 2000, he joined the majority opinion in a 2-1 finding that the FBI could hold on to gun purchase records for six months for auditing purposes, to make sure the instant background check systems worked. The National Rifle Association called the six-month record retention an ""illegal national registration of gun owners,"" while the court found that it was a common-sense auditing system, not a national firearm registry, according to news reports from the time. Our ruling OâReilly said Merrick Garland ""voted, so the folks know, in Washington, D.C., to keep guns away from private citizens."" Garland never heard the case about Washington gun laws from the bench, and so he never voted on it. He voted in favor of reconsidering the case, but itâs impossible to extrapolate from that vote his position on the merits of the case. We rate OâReillyâs claim False.",3/18/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/mar/18/bill-oreilly/bill-oreilly-wrongly-says-merrick-garland-voted-ba/,1,,
"Says Bernie Sanders ""was against the auto bailout"" and ""voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry.""","In Michigan, Hillary Clinton says Bernie Sanders 'was against the auto bailout'.","Sen. Bernie Sanders didnât support the bailout that saved the auto industry, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said of her opponent ahead of the primary in Michigan, a state built on the auto business. ""He was against the auto bailout,"" Clinton said at a  March 6 CNN debate  in Flint, Mich. ""In January of 2009, President-elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry."" Sanders seemed skepticalÂ of this line of critique. ""Well, if you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy,"" he responded. Immediately a bunch of readers asked us to look into this claim to see if Sanders really did oppose the auto bailout, which many people believe  rescued  major automakers struggling to stay afloat during the 2008 Great Recession. First weâll lay out the auto bailout timeline, then weâll explain Sandersâ votes. Basically, Sanders had two opportunities to show his support for auto bailout funds through Senate votes. He supported the bailout in one instance but not the other. In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion  Troubled Asset Relief Program  (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry. That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry, which was in really bad shape. But the measure  failed  in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to  allocate some of the TARP funds  to General Motors and Chrysler. Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the TARP funds went out to the banks and motor companies. So Sanders could have shown his support for the auto bailout in December 2008 when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout and again in January 2009 when members considered blocking TARP funds. Sanders (and Clinton, too)  voted in favor  of the December separate auto bailout. ""I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls,"" Sanders said, according to  Vermont Public Radio , explaining why he supported the measure. However â and this is what Clinton is talking about â Sanders  voted to block  the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds, while Clinton voted for the funds. (Sanders opposed and Clinton supported  the initial TARP bill .) Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed. ""I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law,"" he said in a  statement . ""I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression."" Itâs  unclear  how much of the second half of TARP funds Obama intended to use for the auto bailout at the time.  In a letter to congressional leaders  encouraging them to release the funds, Obama economic adviser Larry Summers said only that auto companies would ""only receive additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability."" Both of Michiganâs then-senators, Democrats  Debbie Stabenow  and  Carl Levin , advocated to continue TARP funding specifically to aid the auto industry, which has a heavy presence in their home state. Auto companies ended up receiving about  about $85 billion  in TARP funds, according to the  New York Times . Itâs possible the auto industry would not have received such a robust bailout if Congress had successfully blocked the second half of the TARP funds and withstood an Obama veto. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRAÂ FACT-CHECKER Our ruling Clinton said Sanders ""was against the auto bailout"" and ""voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry."" Sanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout â though the fundsâ primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed. The claim, though, leaves listeners with the impression that Sandersâ opposed bailing out the auto industry. But he voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.

"Says Travis County Commissioner Gerald Daugherty ""claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent.""",Challenger levels Mostly False claim about Gerald Daugherty voting to hike his salary 19.6 percent.,"With early voting in motion, Travis County Precinct 3 Commissioner candidate Jason Nassour charged his Republican primary opponent, incumbent Gerald Daugherty, with hypocritically voting himself a fat pay raise. ""Your current county commissioner claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent,"" Nassour said on Facebook Feb. 18, 2016. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  SOURCE:  Facebook post,  Jason Nassour , Feb. 18, 2016 (screenshot Feb. 26, 2016) The first part of Nassourâs claim points to Daugherty touting his own fiscal frugality. On Daughertyâs campaign website, for instance, he says he has ""taken an 8 percent pay decrease in each of the nine years he has been in office."" Thatâs nine years in two chunks: Daugherty, a businessman, recaptured the seat representing western Travis County on the five-person commissioners court in 2012 after losing the spot in 2008. The other seats, including the county judgeâs post, are held by Democrats. Nassourâs backup We asked Nassour, an Austin attorney, where he got his number for Daughertyâs vote for a steep salary increase. Nassour pointed us to a screenshot on his campaign Facebook page showing a portion of a Travis County budget document laying out the salary and benefits of the Precinct 3 commissioner in the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years and as proposed for the fiscal 2016 budget. By phone, Nassour said: ""I took this right off the county website. Iâll be the first one to come out and say Iâm wrong, but Iâm in the business of looking at whatâs on paper."" The provided screenshot indicates $82,600 was to be spent on the Precinct 3 commissionerâs salary in 2015 and in the column for the fiscal 2016 proposed budget, the budgeted salary for the commissioner is $101,417, seemingly suggesting an even greater, 23 percent, surge than what Nassour declared. By phone, Nassour said he got the lower 19.6 percent figure by dividing $82,600 by $101,417 and subtracting the result from 1. Our sense: Thatâs not how to calculate the percentage difference (and by Nassourâs approach, we reached a different result, 18.6). County records To get a fix on the relevant figures, we turned to county records where we couldnât find the $82,600 salary for 2015 in posted budget documents. On the countyâs website, that is, the relevant  document  lists the Precinct 3 commissioner salary in 2015 as $90,109, identical to what the county spent on the salary the year before. To our request for clarification, Travis Gatlin, the countyâs budget director, said it looked like Nassour compared actual amounts spent in 2014 and 2015 to the amount budgeted for the commissionerâs salary in 2016. His point: Actual amounts spent can be less than what the county budgets at the start of a fiscal year. By phone, Gatlin also said Nassourâs source documents appeared to be out of date. While the finalized budget was posted once approved at the end of September 2015, figures showing actual spending in 2015 were updated in mid-December 2015, Gatlin said, after expenditures were finalized for the fiscal year, which ran through September 2015, and all payroll information had been Â filed. The amount budgeted Â for each of the four county commissioner salaries in fiscal 2015, for instance, was $98,463. But in the 12 months, the county paid $90,109 for Daughertyâs salary, according to the  budgetâs 2015  actual expenditures data when we looked in late February 2016. Daughertyâs proclaimed lower pay So, take what Daugherty took in pay in 2015 and that breaks out to about 8 percent less than the budgeted base salary for each commissioner that year--as Daugherty says on his campaign website. But thatâs not the full picture. After Daugherty rejoined the body in 2013, he accepted a salary of $90,109 for fiscal 2013, according to his signed  affidavit . At the time, that was about 5.7 percent less (not 8 percent less) than the budgeted salary for each commissioner. In September 2015, most recently, Daugherty signed  an affidavit  saying he would take a salary of $93,000 in fiscal 2016, which was up $2,891, 3.2 percent, from what he took in pay for 2015. (If he had accepted the authorized $101,417, his pay would have increased nearly 13 percent, we calculate.) Daughertyâs vote Even if Daugherty didnât take all of the higher base salary, did he vote for increasing it? When the commissioners began to consider raising their base salaries from $98,463 to $101,417, Daugherty voted against beginning the process of approving 3 percent raises for most county elected officials, according to the minutes of the bodyâs Aug. 11, 2015 meeting. An  Austin American-Statesman  news story  published about the decisive meeting quotes Daugherty saying he thought the commissioners ""ought to try to lead by example in elected officials,"" adding he would prefer if elected officials were required to ask the county for raises rather than garnering across-the-board salary increases. Records show, further, that Daugherty was absent from the Sept. 1, 2015, meeting at which the commissioners court set each commissionerâs 2016 salary at $101,417. Later, though, Daugherty joined his colleagues in voting for adoption of the full 2016 county budget, including the salary changes, at the bodyâs Sept. 29, 2015 meeting, according to meeting  minutes . ""When you vote for the budget, at the end itâs sort of a formality,"" Daugherty told us by phone. ""The budget is done at that stage â¦ Itâs one of our responsibilities, and that happens every year. You donât vote against the budget because thereâs one thing you voted against."" We shared the figures we found with Nassour, who said by phone that he believes he was misled by budget information posted by the county in September 2015. With regards to Daughertyâs reasoning on his vote for approval of the budget, Nassour said, ""If you vote for the budget, you vote for whatâs in it. I know thatâs hard, because when youâre looking at the budget youâre looking at a lot â¦ If there are things in the budget I donât approve of, itâs my job not to vote for it"" or ""say I stand by it."" Our ruling Nassour said Daugherty ""claims to have taken a pay cut, but for 2016, he voted to raise his salary by 19.6 percent."" It looks to us like Daugherty initially opposed certain pay raises for 2016 including those penciled in for commissioners. Still, he later voted for the budget including the raises.Â However, he personally set his own increased salary at an amount some $8,400 less than the newly authorized salary for commissioners. His pay went up 3.2 percent, not nearly 20 percent. We rate this claim Mostly False.

"Says Pat Toomey visited Joe Sestak and other veterans in 2002 ""and then came home and voted against every veterans appropriations bill.""",Joe Sestak says Pat Toomey voted against 'every' veterans appropriations bill since 2002; did he?,"Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is defending his voting record after a challenger has repeatedly claimed the incumbent Pennsylvania senator has a pattern of voting against funding for veterans. Senate candidate Joe Sestak, a Democrat and former congressman, said during a recent luncheon at the Pennsylvania Press Club that Toomey visited him on the USS George Washington aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf in 2002, the carrier Sestak was commanding at the time. ""I may disagree with Pat Toomey, who voted to send me to war, visited me on the aircraft carrier,"" Sestak said, adding, ""and then came home and voted against every veterans appropriations bill."" The Toomey and Sestak campaigns have gone back and forth in email communications to supporters and reporters, criticizing and defending Toomeyâs records on veterans affairs, as they spar to represent voters in Pennsylvania, a state with nearly a million veterans. So we decided to put Sestak's claim to the test: Did Toomey truly did vote against every veterans appropriations bill since 2002? Sestak campaign spokesman Jake Sternberger said in the instance of the Press Club appearance in January, the former Navy admiral was referring to Toomeyâs voting record when he served in the House from 1999 to 2005, though Sestak didnât specify that at the time. His campaign also later highlighted Toomeyâs time in the Senate, noting that he voted against plans in 2011 and 2015 that would have sent additional funds to programming for veterans. When it comes to his time in the House from 1999 to 2005, Toomey did vote against every major veterans appropriations bill, but he also voted in favor of more than a dozen resolutions that kept funding the same. As a senator, Toomeyâs spokesman for re-election Steve Kelly said Toomey   was a ""strong supporter"" of bipartisan Veterans Affairs legislation introduced in 2014, a bill its cosponsor (and current Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders called ""the most comprehensive veteransâ health care legislation in modern history."" In 2011 and 2015, Toomey had already voted in favor of stand-alone veterans appropriations bills, but instead of being signed into law, those dollars were later rolled into ""omnibus bills,"" or plans that funded the entire federal government. Veterans appropriations make up about 6 percent of the funding in the large financing plans. Toomey, a fiscal conservative, voted against the omnibus bills in 2011 and this past December that ultimately would have sent more funds to veterans, but he said it wasnât due to specific line items. ""I have usually voted against these giant, thousand-page, trillion-dollar omnibus spending bills because theyâre such a grossly irresponsible way to fund the government,""  Toomey said recently about his vote against the bills,  according to his campaign. ""They have literally many thousands of individual line items, and I know Congressman Sestak likes to pretend that I must oppose every individual line item because I voted against these grotesque omnibus bills. Thatâs just ridiculous."" Sternberger said itâs ""absolutely"" fair to criticize Toomeyâs record on veterans affairs based on the fact that he twice voted against the omnibus bills. Records show Toomey also voted against the Veterans Jobs Corps Act in 2012 and the Veterans Health and Benefits bill in February 2014, months before the VA scandal led to the resignation of former Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. Toomey later supported bipartisan legislation aimed at improving the VA. Toomey is a member of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus and in 2014 introduced the Protect Veterans Employment and Training Services Act, which aims to provide jobs training services to veterans. The bill died at the end of the congressional session and was not enacted. Our ruling Sestak said that Toomey ""voted against every veterans appropriations bill."" Toomey did vote against major veterans appropriations bills between 2002 and 2005 while in the House. But as a senator, he repeatedly voted in favor of other bills that benefitted vets. Toomey   did vote against veterans appropriations when he voted ""no"" to the omnibus bills in 2011 and 2015, but   he also voted ""yes"" to stand-alone bills the same year and didnât support the larger spending plans for reasons beyond the veterans appropriations. Sestak and his campaign mischaracterized Toomeyâs record on veterans appropriations by saying Toomey voted against funding veterans programming ""every"" time.

"SaysÂ Bernie Sanders ""voted for what we call the 'Charleston Loophole.'""",Fact-checking Hillary Clinton's claim that Bernie Sanders supported 'Charleston Loophole'.,"Trying to highlight an area where she is to the left of her opponent, Hillary Clinton attacked Bernie Sanders for his position on guns during the NBC-YouTube Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C. Guns are a particularly emotional topic in South Carolina after Dylann Roof was accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston church in June. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, defended his record on guns saying that he ""supported from day one an instant background check to make certain that people who should not have guns do not have guns."" Clinton fired back at Sanders with a list of his votes on gun bills, including this one: ""He voted for what we call the âCharleston loophole.â "" We wanted to know what Clinton meant by the ""Charleston loophole"" and if Sanders voted for it. Brady bill Clinton  and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks for gun purchases, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say blame actually goes to the FBI and its botched paperwork. Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System. (The rest of the states do their own background checks.) If the check isnât denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. Roof was able to get a gun as a result of clerical errors. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., on April 11. An FBI examiner found that Roof had been arrested for a drug charge March 1. Because the records didnât show a conviction, the examiner couldnât deny the purchase but continued to look into Roofâs criminal history. Roofâs rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring countyâs sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information from the wrong offices. When the three days were up, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. He faces  trial on murder charges  later this year. Those three days were at the heart of the the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which passed in 1993. A word about waiting periods: The Brady Bill didnât contain a waiting period that required purchasers to wait to receive their firearm. (Some advocates like this idea, because they believe it might prevent impulsive acts of gun violence.) Rather, the bill set a time limit -- sometimes called a default to proceed -- for the government to conduct its background checks. Sanders, then in the U.S. House of Representatives,  voted against the Brady Bill five times  -- including a version that  reinstated a five-day time limit for background checks.  In November 1993, Sanders voted  for  an amendment imposing an  instant background check  instead. The problem was technology for instant checks didnât exist at the time. As a result, according to the  Washington Post  Fact-Checker , supporters of the Brady bill were forced to negotiate a compromise. What first was proposed as 10 days for the government to conduct the check ultimately was whittled to three days. The final compromise version of the Brady bill was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. It prohibited the transfer of a gun to an unlicensed individual, unless three business days have lapsed and the system has not notified the transferor that it would violate the law. Sanders voted against the final bill. Sandersâ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told us in July that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. (We did not get a response from the Sandersâ campaign on debate night about Clintonâs attack.) So to recap: Sanders supported shortening the time the government had to conduct background checks. Whether extra time would have kept Roof from purchasing a gun is unclear. Clinton said that Sanders ""voted for what we call the Charleston loophole."" In 2015, Roof was able to buy a gun after time ran out for the government to perform a background check Â -- the result of a clerical error when the FBI sought records from the wrong local law enforcement agency about Roof. Whether more time would have made a difference remains unknown. But Roof was able to purchase the gun after a three-day waiting period expired. Sanders voted in 1993 to shorten the time window for the government to conduct its check. Roof was able to purchase a gun after waiting out a three-day time limit on background checks. We rate this claim Mostly True. Clarification: This fact-check was edited on Jan. 19 to clarify waiting periods and and time limits on background checks.

"Says Marco Rubio ""knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion.""",Cruz is right in back-and-forth with Rubio about vote on defense spending.,"Sen. Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen. Marco Rubioâs attacks at the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina were ""flat-out false."" One attack pinpointed Cruzâs record on military spending. ""The only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget for (Sen.) Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense,"" Rubio said. Cruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim. ""The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion,"" Cruz said. ""What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true."" Rubio has  criticized Cruzâs record  on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections. But on his specific point about voting for Rubioâs amendment, Cruz is right. (We're not fact-checking whether Rubio ""knows full well"" about Cruz's vote.) Trying to counteract  defense spending cuts  over the past few years, Rubio put forth an  amendment  to increase military spending in  March 2015 . If passed, the amendment would have raised projected defense spending outlays through 2022 in Congressâ proposed budget. Cruz  voted  for the amendment. The measure failed 32-68. Cruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but itâs a little unclear exactly how much Rubioâs amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defenseâs 2012  fiscal year request , which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But  Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. , who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion. The very  same day , the Senate voted on a Paul  amendment  that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio  both voted  against the amendment, and it failed 4-96. Our ruling Cruz said Rubio ""knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion."" Cruz did indeed vote for a failed Rubio amendment that would have increased military spending after years of spending cuts. Â While the amendment didnât specifically say spending would be increased to $697 billion, that figure was part of the discussion among the billâs proponents. Cruzâs point is right on, so we rate his statement True.",1/15/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/gop-debate-cruz-says-he-voted-rubio-defense-spendi/,1,,
"""Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people.""",Hillary Clinton's Syrian airstrikes claim against Marco Rubio ignores difference in strategy.,"With Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio attacking Democrat Hillary Clinton's foreign policy decisions, the Clinton campaign has fired back by asserting that ""Marco Rubio Distorts Clintonâs Foreign Policy Record â And His Own."" The HillaryClinton.com webpage  notes that Rubio "" claimed  that Hillary Clinton 'stood by' while the conflict in Syria devolved into a humanitarian crisis. The truth is that Hillary Clinton was an early supporter for arming the moderate opposition against Assad in 2012."" ""And whatâs even more amazing,"" according to the Clinton campaign, ""is that Marco Rubio voted  against  authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people."" We were curious if the ""even more amazing"" claim about Rubio was true, and he actually opposed Syrian airstrikes. PolitiFact has ventured into this area before, as a Clinton spokesman was quick to point out. In September 2013, Rubio was one of seven members on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (including two Democrats) to vote against  authorizing U.S. military action against Syria . Three Republicans joined seven Democrats to approve the measure. The Senate resolution was debated on the floor but  never came up for a vote  because a diplomatic solution to the chemical weapons issue surfaced and  Obama asked Congress  to put off action. At the time, as a former senator and secretary of state, and a budding 2016 presidential candidate, Clinton  publicly supported airstrikes . Asked about his vote during the Sept. 16, 2015, CNN GOP presidential debate, Rubio said he opposed the action because President Obama ""said the attack that he was going to conduct was going to be a pinprick."" PolitiFact ruled that because Obama had repeatedly stated that pinprick attacks were not what he wanted to do, Rubio's statement was  False . In the debate, Rubio added that, ""The United States military was not built to conduct pinprick attacks,"" and he wanted a strategy that would put ""men and women in a position where they can win."" RubioÂ spokeswoman Brooke SammonÂ indicated that opposition to those airstrikes doesn't mean Rubio was opposed to the United States becoming involved in Syria, which Rubio made clear during the  Foreign Relations Committee meeting  where he explained his vote. He predicted that the airstrikes would not work and reiterated his longstanding call for Obama to give arms to the moderate opposition in Syria. On Sept. 18, 2014, when the president asked Congress for approval to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels as part of a larger plan to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS),  Rubio voted in favor  of the proposal, which was part of a larger spending package. Clinton has  advocated arming Syrian rebels  as well. The Clinton website tries to make Rubio look reluctant to take on Syria or make it look like the senator has flip-flopped, including a quote from Politico that "" Rubio was an early advocate of arming the Syrian rebels ,"" and a Politico headline reporting that "" Rubio the hawk turned dovish on Syria in 2013 ."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""Marco Rubio voted against authorizing President Obama to strike Syria after Assad used chemical weapons on his own people."" Rubio did vote against the specific resolution for an airstrike campaign, explaining he was ""unconvinced it will work."" But he supported a subsequent plan for the United States to help moderate Syrian rebels lead the fight, an idea he had been promoting for a while. The Clinton statement suggests a reluctance by Rubio to intervene in Syria when, in fact, it's the type of involvement that's at issue. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.",1/7/16,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jan/07/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-syrian-air-strikes-claim-against-/,1,,
