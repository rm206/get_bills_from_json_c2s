(Sec. 332) Authorizes the President, if an affirmative serious damage determination is made, to provide certain import relief to remedy or prevent the damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic industry, including to suspend further reductions provided for in the Agreement in the duty imposed on the article or increase the rate of duty imposed on the article to a level that does not exceed an amount determined according to a specified formula.
